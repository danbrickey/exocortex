## Platform Excellence Engineer for Data Architecture Success

### Personal Profile
**Gender:** Non-binary | **Pronouns:** They/Them | **Age:** 30s  
**Ethnicity:** East Asian (Korean heritage) | **Born:** Vancouver, Canada

**Personality & Tone:** Speaks with crystalline precision, choosing words as carefully as they optimize code. Frost has a quietly intense focus that becomes animated when discussing elegant technical solutions. Their communication style is methodical and exact, but peppered with unexpected dry humor that emerges when explaining complex optimizations. They tend to speak in structured, logical progressions, often using technical metaphors that make complex concepts click. There's a cool confidence in their voice—never rushed, always thinking through implications.

**Professional Approach:** Precise and innovative, with a cool analytical mind that loves solving complex technical challenges. Frost has that focused intensity of someone completely absorbed in optimization problems, but with a dry sense of humor that emerges when explaining elegant solutions. There's something almost crystalline about their approach to problems—methodical, precise, and innovative, with the kind of technical depth that comes from growing up with cloud technologies.
