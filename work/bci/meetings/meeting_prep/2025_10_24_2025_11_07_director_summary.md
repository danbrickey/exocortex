## Detailed Summary

The past two weeks have seen **significant strategic progress** alongside **intensive operational firefighting**. The team successfully secured **AI governance approval for Snowflake Cortex**, established a **progressive "Logic Guide" documentation framework** for business-IT collaboration, and continued advancing **Provider MVP** planning with strong stakeholder engagement.

However, the **test environment stabilization** has required substantial focused effort, with over 1000 model and test failures demanding systematic resolution. The **member consecutive coverage temporal merge bug**—a complex date-range merging issue affecting eligibility data—was diagnosed and resolved through intensive work sessions with the data engineering team. This bug was impacting downstream eligibility extracts and represents both a **technical debt cleanup** and **critical data quality** improvement.

**Organizational changes** announced by Ram indicate a **strategic shift toward Snowflake and solution architecture specialization**, with new positions being posted next week. The job requirements suggest external hiring focus, with minimal impact to existing team structures in the near term, though broader IT reorganization remains under consideration.

The **NDW refactoring effort**—migrating away from the decade-old legacy ETL engine—has advanced with Cameron and Brian making progress on converting workflows to run entirely in HDS. This represents **critical technical debt reduction** and **system modernization**.

**Business alignment** continues to strengthen through terminology standardization ("Logic Guides" vs "Business Rules"), progressive documentation adoption, and active data council formation for Provider, Member, and Product domains.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. "Logic Guide" Terminology Adoption
- **Decision**: Rename "business rules documentation" to "logic guides" for business consumption
- **Rationale**: Better conveys purpose; reduces confusion with formal business rules management terminology
- **Impact**: Clearer stakeholder communication; better alignment with progressive documentation framework
- **Implementation**: Updated prompt templates; Data Governance will pilot with Provider team on PCP attribution
- **Status**: Approved; pilot validation in progress

### 2. Four-Audience Documentation Framework
- **Decision**: Expand progressive documentation to four audience levels: Executive, General Business, Business Analyst, Engineering
- **Rationale**: Better serves diverse stakeholder needs from leadership overview to technical troubleshooting
- **Impact**: Improved documentation utility across organizational levels; facilitates handoff to business ownership
- **Implementation**: Revised prompts generating multi-level documentation
- **Status**: Framework defined; examples being validated with Data Governance

### 3. Alation Engineering Hub Workflow
- **Decision**: Use Alation Engineering Hub as staging area for logic guide handoff to business
- **Rationale**: Enables business to transition documentation into Alation Business Rules area; maintains synchronization path
- **Impact**: Establishes bi-directional workflow between engineering (dbt) and business (Alation)
- **Long-term Goal**: Use business-approved Alation logic guides to validate dbt code
- **Status**: Workflow design in progress; return path mechanism under development

### 4. Dynamic Tables Security Limitation Escalation
- **Decision**: Escalate data masking policy tag propagation limitation to Snowflake product team via Ronga
- **Rationale**: Dynamic tables don't handle data masking logic, preventing tag propagation for near real-time pipelines
- **Impact**: Blocks full implementation of near real-time use cases with proper security controls
- **Next Steps**: Ronga investigating product roadmap; follow-up meeting Wednesday
- **Risk**: May require architecture workaround if not on near-term roadmap

### 5. Member Consecutive Coverage Temporal Merge Fix
- **Decision**: Architect-led rewrite of temporal merge logic rather than delegating to less-experienced engineers
- **Rationale**: Complex date-range merging logic; faster resolution with direct architectural involvement
- **Impact**: Critical bug resolved affecting eligibility extracts; improved data quality
- **Technical Details**: Fixed cross-join implementation for start/end date generation; resolved incorrect membership population
- **Status**: Code rewritten and incorporated into dbt model; validation in progress

### 6. Amazon Q Pro Account Request
- **Decision**: Request Amazon Q Pro account upgrade from free tier
- **Rationale**: Free tier context limits insufficient for complex HDS→EDP refactoring scenarios (thousands of lines of legacy code)
- **Impact**: Free tier adequate for simple 3NF→Raw Vault refactoring but blocks complex business vault refactoring
- **Next Steps**: Contact AWS admins for Pro account provisioning
- **Alternative**: Investigate chunking strategies if Pro account unavailable
