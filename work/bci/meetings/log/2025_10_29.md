# BCI Interop EDP data source discovery 
About the Abacus: To continue with our data discovery series of meetings, we went over mostly other people's wheelhouses, so I didn't have a ton to add. We did discuss some of the government programs feeds and so on, some of the details around those, and we were able to get some additional details on the need for clinical and pharmacy data. We're getting down to the bottom of the list, but each progressive answer is getting more difficult to come up with. 

# Snowflake DBT hands-on walkthrough 
Met with Lakshmi and her team:
- Dave Johnstone
- Leonardo Rizzoli
- Sam Jesse
- Tamara Hess
- Lakshmi Chandran 
We went through DBT stuff. I started with the source data project, we added some sources, talked through about how that works. Next session, we're going to add the actual pipelines in the data domains project. We did cover what the data domains project was, how it worked, and how it was structured, and talked about the possibility of their team deciding whether to have their own repository or just stick with the shared repository EDP data domains.

# EDP Provider Data Council Meeting 
Met with the Provider Data Council to discuss various topics around provider data management, quality, and integration strategies. Key points of discussion included:
We discussed their detailed use cases and data sources that they need to access. So both from an ingestion and a solutioning side we are trying to narrow down the possibilities so that we can come up with a provider MVP model that we can finish next quarter. And then progressively a version 2, 3, and 4 of that model over the next four quarters.

We are pretty close on our definitions, but they still haven't decided which thing they want to measure the most so that we can focus on that. But we are getting there. The conversations are going well, and they seem to be excited about the possibilities.
