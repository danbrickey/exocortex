# Benefits/Product Metrics
% Standard / Non Standard in a Book Of Business
Benefit Scorecards: How each product is performing (HCE helped with this)
Automated product configuration validation / testing between contract/benefit spreadsheet/facets
How products change over time / by market / etc.

Product lifecycle is annual based on calendar year
start of plan year determines the year of the product matrix we use
Self-funded business works independently somewhat from the rest of the product development
GERC Group Elig Renewal/Change (Roxanne Ellis)
- Buy-up solution choice + benefit package
- Group profile that comes from the GREC sheet goes to Facets config
- Rates
- Application
IRIS Quote-to-card (electronic GERC)
- electronic enrollment/contracting
- small & mid-sized, fully insured groups excluding balance funded
**Process flow:**
- begin -> CBS Setup -> UW -> Benefit config -> OES -> EBS -> CBS Comm -> Contracts -> final
