## Meetings

### CMS Inbound Pipeline Discussion
Met with Lindsay Smith, Lakshmi Chandran, and Kelly Good Clark to discuss transitioning the CMS inbound pipeline to DBT.

They're not really following the same patterns as other data engineering teams right now. They're creating some dynamic tables in the raw layer and the consumption layer. We want them to switch - they can keep using dynamic tables, but we want them to use DBT. For the ingestion steps (how we pull data in through the stream from AWS S3 buckets into Snowflake), we want them to use the same pattern that's been used for other ingestion.

The team was very open to using DBT, so I think I'll try to start them on that transition.

**Potential Mentees Identified:**
- **Leo**: More skilled in DBT and modern data architecture
- **Dave**: Solid business knowledge and analyst skills, junior data engineering skills, high energy and anxious to work
- **Sam**: Most business knowledge (might be most difficult domain to tackle), solid technical knowledge but mostly limited to older tech (stored procedures in Sybase and SQL Server, SSIS packages)

Not sure who would be the best fit. I can't really take them on immediately, but maybe a month or two from now (end of December). One interesting idea: one of my current mentees would be a good, less senior option to mentor someone else - that would be good experience for them.

### Abacus Data Source Q&A Session
Another data source question and answer meeting with Abacus (our new Interop data partner). Satish Dhanasekar and Lorraine Maldonado represented Abacus.

The discussion went well - it was easier than the last ones. Still just as long, but we made it through a lot more stuff. Satish had been hyper-focused in the last meeting or two on some of the claim payment tables we have that are non-standard in Facets today. He seemed to struggle with understanding those initially, but we spent a little time talking about it today and I think he finally got it.

Hopefully tomorrow we can wrap up the initial list of data sources and start talking about the details of the work.

### EDP Provider Network Set Review
Talked with Lindsay and Rich Tallon about the provider network set difficulties we face.

Rich shared some of his attempts at crosswalking the data with all the different values we need to attach to a network, which include:
- The SAFIRE version of the network
- The BCBS BSA version of the network
- Our own versioning/consolidation of the network

For instance, they have networks like PPO01 and PPO02 that indicate a sequence of really the same network but modified - they're versioning the PPO network, but all of them are valid in the time frame they existed in.

We need quite a bit of business analyst data entry work. It shouldn't be high-volume data entry work, but we do need to interface this with a few different tables and design a schema for them to update. Probably deliver that with Streamlit and Snowflake. Once we have that information, we can share it with Abacus, who also needs this information about providers and the networks they belong to.

**Follow-up needed**: The data entry tool should be fairly simple to write, but the data engineering teams probably aren't the right teams for that work. Need to talk to Lindsay about what our options are there.

### DBT Test Environment Setup
Met with Jason, Shreya, Brad, and Amith to reconfigure the DBT environments for our projects.

The Snowflake Admins have created a test environment in NorthStar, so we created that parallel environment in DBT, configured the connections, set up a test job, set the environment variables, and double-checked our logic.

When we went to run our test job, we got a permissions/ownership problem in Snowflake. The Snowflake Admins were going to fix that this afternoon, and we'll give it another shot tomorrow.

## Personal Work & Career Development

### Data Modeling System
Made some headway on my data modeling system. Good progress, but still a long way to go.

### Documentation Prompt Refinement
Started trying to refine my documentation prompt to be architecture-focused to help me build out documentation for the EDP.

### Master's Degree Application
Worked on my Master's degree admission statement for the UVU application tonight.

### Career Positioning
Started working on a pitch for Ram to let him know about my Master's program and to position myself for some AI projects at work.

## Reflections

Had a hard time staying focused today. Despite the concentration challenges, ended up making progress on multiple fronts - both work meetings and personal career development activities. The Abacus session going more smoothly was particularly encouraging.
