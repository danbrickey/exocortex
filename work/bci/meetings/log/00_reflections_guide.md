# Mentoring-Specific Questions
---
1. Mentoring Opportunities Identified

"What situations today were mentoring opportunities?"
"Did someone come to me for guidance? How did I handle it?"
"Was there a moment where I could have taught strategic thinking?"

2. How I Showed Up

"Was I direct or tentative?"
"Did I explain the 'why' (strategic reasoning)?"
"Did I use 'architect voice' or 'peer voice'?"
"What specific language did I use?" (quote yourself if you can remember)

3. What I Could Have Done Better

"If I could redo that interaction, what would I change?"
"What stopped me from being clearer?"
"Was I hedging? What was I protecting?"

4. Opportunities I Missed

"Were there moments I could have been more directive?"
"Did I let something slide that should have been a teaching moment?"
"Did I do work I should have delegated as a learning opportunity?"

5. Wins to Celebrate

"When did I nail it today?"
"What felt different/better than before?"
"What evidence did I collect that being direct works?"

# Weekly Meta-Review
---
## "What patterns did I notice this week?"
- Where did I do well consistently?
- Where did I struggle consistently?
- What triggered the old patterns most?
- What's getting easier?
- What's still really hard?
- What do I want to focus on next week?

## For Each Mentee:
Name: [Person]
- This week's mentoring moments:
  - What situations arose?
  - What guidance did I give?
  - What did I teach/model?
- Their response:
  - How did they receive it?
  - Did they apply it?
  - What growth am I seeing?
  - Any resistance or challenges?
- Wins to report:
  - Specific things they did well
  - Progress I can share with management
  - Kudos-worthy achievements
- Next focus area:
  - What do they need to work on next?
  - What's my plan for teaching that?
- My capacity check:
  - Is this sustainable?
  - Am I overextending?
  - Do I need to adjust?

## What "Focused Mentoring" Looks Like
For your 3-4 selected mentees:
Weekly:

Intentional check-in (can be 15 minutes)
One teaching moment per week minimum
Specific feedback on their work
Strategic thinking questions

Monthly:

Explicit growth conversation
"Here's what I've noticed you improving at"
"Here's what I want you to focus on next"
"What questions do you have about the field/your growth?"

Quarterly:

Bigger picture conversation
Career trajectory discussion
Skills assessment
Adjustment of mentoring focus

For everyone else:

Still be helpful in the moment
Still answer questions when asked
Still give feedback when appropriate
But not structured, intentional mentoring
