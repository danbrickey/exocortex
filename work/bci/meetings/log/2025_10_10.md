# ram / dan 1-on-1
Had a one-on-one with Ram today, it was pretty short. He's traveling the rest of the afternoon and is going to India next week. He did give me an email thread that he forwarded to me that he needed some context on, so I need to read through that and see, and give him my opinion on who should be working on the work discussed in the email thread. 

# EDP team one office hours. 
This meeting was supposed to be for a demo from of accomplishments from last sprint. There wasn't really anything flashy to show, but we did want to demonstrate the environment rename the role, rename the RBAC setup, the creation of a new test environment, and we did want to show the dbt side of that as well, the use of the dev raw clone DB. However, none of the leadership was able to make it. Both Margaret and Ram were out, and I can't remember who else was invited to that. 

# Reflections and personal goals. 
I followed up with Martin today on the task I gave him. He wanted a little bit of additional information which I sent to him. I need to evaluate him on this task, so I think I'm going to run the code I passed off to him through a refactoring process that I'm working on to give me an idea of what his code should look like coming out the other end, and then I can compare it. I'm not really grading him against auto-generated code, but I do need a point of reference. Reading through the dental email thread, it's a little confusing. The thread seems to start in late June or early July. They requested some work from a specific team, our business automation team. The business automation team said, "Cool, we'll do that, but we can't get to it until October." That began the email thread of them trying to escalate it to see if we could get it done before October. I just found out about it today, and it's almost the middle of October. So the escalation path is taking just as long as the work was supposed to take. When I looked at that team's backlog, they do have two in progress user stories and a feature created to track this specific work, and it looks like people are working on it. I'm not sure how to respond to Ram. I think I'll take the whole email thread and the attachments and try to feed them into an AI so that I can get them summarized and look for some specific details in there about what's happening because the thread itself is kind of confusing as are the JIRA user stories and history. 
In the personal goal category, I worked through some things. I have decided to try to formalize my mentorship of a couple of people on the teams that I work with. I want to select people who are likely to appreciate my mentorship and likely to be able to learn and put some of that stuff to work quickly, to make them better at their job.

Most of this mentoring is exposure to architectural thinking, exposure to team lead style thinking about not just solving a problem but using a pattern to solve a problem. That can be applied to other similar problems: establishing standards, evaluating the quality of our work not just whether it does work. And also paying some special attention to AI-enabled workflows and what types of things we can leverage AI against. We don't have a lot of tooling in our corporate environment that's approved, however that's going to happen, and in order to be ready for it when it happens so that we can take advantage of something like an AI coding assistant. We need to have some of these patterns worked out and have tried to apply them even if it's sort of cumbersome to do that in our current environment. I think that we will get a less cumbersome approach, but we need to be ready with how to work for it, how to work with it, to provide context, to provide details, to provide structure and enough instruction for the AI to do the work we're asking it to do, and in a sort of intuitive understanding of what work AI does best versus what work a human should do. Those are sort of organizational competencies and skill levels that we can apply to problems, but not until we have that skill, not until we've moved up the learning curve a little bit. I think there are lots of individuals inside of our organization that are developing those skills independently of our organization. But our organization itself is not developing those skills we're being encouraged to. We're not being given the tools or the capability.

I don't really want to focus on tooling any of the tools or the LLMs out there, regardless of how they perform right now. Some are good at some things, and some are good at other things. But eventually, I think the playing field will stay fairly level. They'll be leapfrogging each other with capabilities and applications that they can take on. In general, understanding how to use any LLM is a skill that we don't have in our organization in a center of excellence or community of practice kind of way. So I'd like my mentoring to encourage that community of practice and that professional development, even if the company itself isn't supporting it yet.
