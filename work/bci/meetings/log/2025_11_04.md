# Meeting log for November 4, 2025

# Architecture group discussion. 
Not with the Architecture group worked on or discussed some of the problems we're having in BCI at large and some of the initiatives that EA is working towards. It was a good discussion. Sani and I ended up talking about AI use cases, and that was a good discussion as well. 

# Eligibility flattened to refresh additional errors. 
I met with Carl real briefly and went through some additional errors that the eligibility flattened dependencies are coming up with. We resolved a couple of them, but we still have those overlapping dates as an issue, and we're going to work on that. We decided we'd focus on that one hour a day for the rest of the week to see if we can get through that member consecutive coverage, which not only is getting tripped up by some overlapping date ranges from the source but it appears to not be really working the way it was intended. This is more of a bug than an implementation issue, but I think we can figure that out. 

# Non-meeting time. 
Worked on some documentation for business rules. Came up with a new prompt to try and get a little more natural language feel in there and to include a fourth audience. So now the audience is:
1. Executive/executive leadership
2. General business (targeted at lower-level management, product owners, and so on)
3. Business analyst level which calls out field names and shows some example SQL
4. Engineering details which talk about some of the logistics and common troubleshooting issues and so on

I'll use this new, newly revised prompt to generate some logic documentation and we'll hand it off to the business with the data governance folks. They can have the business analyst review the document to see if they're happy with the formatting. Then we're going to try to come up with a way to interface between GitHub and Alation, or to just make the workflow work out so I can produce this documentation as part of my refactoring, hand it over to the business, and have them incorporate their changes in Alation. We're working on the process to do that, and probably there's an engineering hub in Alation that I can upload documents to, and then the business can hopefully pick them up and transition them into Business Rules Documentation in Alation. Then I need to figure out the return trip for the data because I want to consume the results of the business analyst efforts, not my original document. Eventually I'd like to be able to use the business rules in Elation to evaluate the code in dbt. Not sure exactly how to bridge that gap, but that's the goal. 

Also spent some time working on the test execution failures for the test environment.
