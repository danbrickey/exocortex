Alright, no stand-up today because everybody was busy. I had several hours of focus time today, which was super nice. I worked on documentation and doing some brain dumps on a few different topics. I also added to my to-do list a few brain dumps I need to do for the engineering knowledge base based on questions that we were getting from a vendor or an interoperability partner. As I try to document the EDP project, it's going to be a little bit piecemeal, so I'm just going to use cues from coworkers and vendor partners on what I should document next. I figure that way, the most frequently requested stuff will get done soonest. 

# DBT Troubleshooting
I met with Shreya Thacker today to try and troubleshoot the issue we were having with the Franken environment reference that was still left in our codebase somehow. It wasn't in the codebase, but we did solve the problem. The problem was that the most recent job manifest in the upstream project for cross-project references did not have an updated job manifest and it was using the manifest to determine which environment to pull the staging raw data from. All we had to do is get a job to successfully run in that environment, which creates an updated manifest, and then everything worked. Kind of frustrating that we didn't understand that we need to do that every time we make a change to the project connections and the cross-project references (like staging environment assignments, etc.) 

# BCI Data Discovery Session 2 with Abacus Interoperability Partner. 
This was a 2-hour, fairly intense technical discussion between myself, our FHIR developer, Rich Tallon, and the Abacus architect (Satish) to understand use cases and requirements that have dependencies outside of what they were already doing prior to this particular engagement. We covered several topics, including:
1. Medical claims, pharmacy claims and membership.
2. The source systems, both legacy Facets and Gemstone Facets, and a provider source called Simplr.

We had some detailed discussions around those topics. I made some notes on some brain dumps I need to do. 
  - cl03 and cl04
  - dbar
  - sbad audit
  - source tables organized by BCI business domain
  - pharmacy, pharmacy claims, and prescriber assignment
