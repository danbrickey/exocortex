# EDP Team 1 Daily Stand-Up 
Emanuel and Sani were the only ones in the meeting. Emanuel dropped pretty quick after I gave my update. Sam and I talked about AI use cases and methodologies and techniques. And I talked about my file and documentation management, prompt management system in VS Code and volunteered to walk him through it. So that might be a good coaching opportunity. Although he might turn out to know more than I do. 

# EDP data governance and Hakoda artifact synchronization. 
I met with Nicole Bow, Tina Day, and Shay Harding. Nicole and Tina are from Data Governance, and Shay is from Hakoda. We discussed how to keep our project documentation synchronized with the business. As part of my code refactoring process, I have been creating some business rules documents for the last couple of weeks and I have a handful of them. I don't know how appropriate they are for the business, they're just the type of document I would want to read if I was telling somebody about the business rule, who was in the business, or as an engineer if I was trying to troubleshoot something with the process. I sent those handful of documents to Nicole and Tina to see what they thought of this structure. They're fairly detailed documents, but I don't know if they are going to play well with the business. What we'd want to do is work on that documentation format so that they feel pretty good about sharing it with the business. Then we would hand that documentation over to the business, at which point they would start owning it, they would edit it, change it, and so on themselves to keep it up to date. We also need a feedback loop. They're going to do that process in a tool called Elation, and the engineering side of it we'll need to figure out how to go and get those business rule documentation so that we can do code compare, code evaluation using their business rule documents.

The Business Rule Documents are progressive. They start with an Executive Summary, move on to Stakeholder summaries, Level Summaries, and then move into Business Analyst level detail followed by Engineering detail. So there's just a progressive document that slowly gets more and more detail. I gave them my examples, and they're going to take those examples to the business to talk through. Is this good or bad? Or is this useful or not? Or what would we want it to look like? 


# Ruby Delphi exercise continued. 
Continue the discussion around the Ruby data service that we're trying to spin up. This is going to be a separate data engineering team that will be supervised by the business and will be outside of IT. So, data and analytics folks from inside of IT don't have a lot to contribute, but James Mills and I offered what advice we could.
