# Clarification of Martin's role. 
Chatted with Lindsey about the role of Martin Rivera on our team as a contractor. I was under the impression that he was going to help with continuing our code migration proof of concept. Sounds like she has him more focused on the business alignment goals and filling in the roadmap for Q1, the epics and features. So the epics and features work is work that Emily Souder started. Lindsey would like him or Martin to draft the epics and feature descriptions with solid benefit hypothesis, acceptance criteria, and technical considerations. Then Lindsey wants to do some deeper dives on each of those epics. 

# Abacus data source discovery session 3 
Okay, this was a very long two-hour meeting. We dove into talking about dependencies for the membership product and provider. Those are going to be the themes for this quarter. I think we talked through some of the details about CMS 9915 and CMS 0057 which are mandates that require us to turn in benefit and pharmacy and formulary data to CMS. The CMS will put it into a repository that members can query which is great. We were talking about the requirements for that because that's a hard requirement for next year that we have that capability. We also discussed the other use_cases, the analytical ones. That one is kind of an operational use_case. The analytical use_cases are for member, provider, and product are a little different but we work through some of those dependencies as well. We're trying to separate the work they need to do this quarter vs. the work they need to do in the 2026 quarters. That went well. We'll probably need two or three more of these long meetings, and we may need a couple of side deep dives for just the technical folks on the call. 

# Sync on provider use_cases. 
Met with Martin Rivera, new contractor. We discussed the provider use_cases that I could delegate to him, and the one I decided on was the provider agreement dimension. It's relatively simple, still in the provider domain, and we don't have it as required as the provider dimension. But the main provider dimension is ridiculously complicated, so I wanted to cut our teeth on something simpler as we get our work process figured out. Sent him a package this afternoon because he doesn't have access to our ETL tool that we use on-prem or to the SQL Server instance that we have all of the code on. I've submitted a security request, but it hasn't completed and probably won't for a couple more days. For the interim, I am just sending him the code and a screenshot of the DAG. 

# Call with Brian Senseman
Met Brian today. Brian is an architect that Ram is considering hiring for a contract. We're not sure exactly how the contract is going to work, and we haven't signed the NDAs or anything with them. This was just an introductory call. Seems very competent, deep experience in the data warehousing and analytics world, seems very current on different architectures and methodologies that are used out there. Ram was really impressed with him when he worked with him at a previous company, and feels like his guidance would be really helpful as we start to engage with the business on these specific data domains and creating councils and business processes to support our data engineering. In the past, that's been a very difficult thing to do. We have a more structured approach with a lot of executive backing now, and so he wants some architectural horsepower and experience to add to our team. Anyway, Brian seemed awesome. He seemed like he would be good to work with, very intelligent, and well-informed. Has worked in the healthcare space quite a bit and in fact has done provider-centric data models at a healthcare provider rather than a payer, but a lot of that experience will translate. 

# Provider Deep Dive Part One 
Met with provider folks. We started working through the detailed version of the EDP roadmap. We have some general data domains and a projected schedule for working on them, but we needed to find the specific deliverables we're going to do in each quarter or try to sequence at least the next few quarters at a high level. To this end, we started going through the requirements that sort of the general source information and dependencies that the provider department has listed for us in terms of analytics and data needs. We started trying to drill into the details of each of those datasets that they need to place them into some kind of order taking into account whatever dependencies they have. An example is one of the use_cases we're approaching for the EDP is to create fire data feeds out to CMS to fulfill two new mandatory CMS requirements:
1. CMS 9915
2. CMS 0057
They go into effect, I believe, at the end of next year or the beginning of 2027, and so they are a priority because it's a mandatory thing. We're working with inter-ops partner to develop them, but we have to provide all of the dependencies and that is a significant thing for provider. The other thing that they're very interested in, in terms of immediate value, is a data feed going out to a company called Aveliti. They are going to be a managed service partner that manages our provider web portal. They have a commercial product that they can integrate our data into, and they have a security model that works for us. The private providers can log in and submit claims and post requests and things like that, and see their information. Neither of those things are analytical use_cases, but they do represent things that have value to the business. The analytical use_cases we're starting to talk about are around the beginnings of a provider fact. Like, what metrics do we want to calculate? What are our key indicators for providers? How do we want to measure providers specifically? So as we get the dimensional model starting to flush out the idea is here is we would build a fact table to support provider centric metrics. We're not sure exactly what that looks like. 

# reflections on personal goals
Today I finished delegating that task to Martin, who's a contractor. I wasn't as concerned this time, so my anxiety didn't really spike. But I did feel a little more prepared. It took some time to gather my thoughts and prepare what I was going to say to Martin. Not specifically around "here's the assignment, go do it," but around how I was going to present the information. That seemed to help me. Not really a script, just sort of getting everything loaded into my personal RAM in my brain. Anyway, so significant reduction in the anxiety leading up to that, but I think mostly because I sort of took some time. I think I still need to work on overriding that anxiety in the moment, like if something is thrown at me and I know I need to delegate it or I know I need to tell somebody to do something, those surprise delegations can come with some anxiety. So, hopefully, even though I'm sort of planning my delegations right now, hopefully that will lead to real being able to react in real time without anxiety. A lot of the delegation just turned out to be knowledge transfer, which I'm totally comfortable doing. It's a system I'm really familiar with because I helped build parts of it. So I think this was a little bit more technical grounded than me imposing my will on somebody. Martin was already kind of thinking in the framework that he needs to come to me for work. So, that helped. Clearly defined relationships always help. 

In terms of suppressing emotions or not speaking, not acknowledging emotional things while they are small, I identified another irritation in one of my meetings. Or not really an irritation, a place where we have struggled as a company in the past. We talked about pharmacy data as part of our deep dive into the Abacus information and their dependencies and what they need. One of them is the formulary. We get a claims file feed, a claims experience, like a transactional file, but our PBM partner does not send us a formulary. They're willing to email us a spreadsheet on an ad hoc basis, but for some reason, they're really resistant to the idea of setting up a file feed. This is not a new thing; this has been an issue with each pharmacy benefit management company that we have contracted with during my tenure at Blue Cross of Idaho, which is four different PBMs. To me, that's a pattern, and it always stresses me out a little bit when people start talking about "Hey, we're going to take the formulary and figure out the tiers and be able to report information on how we structure our formulary and how it changes and what it looked like when the claim was filed and all that stuff." In the meeting when that came up, I spoke up and said, "Hey, here is my experience with being able to get formularies." The reaction was great - people took it seriously, people were concerned in the same way that I was. One of the people on the call, I'd like to say I delegated to them, but they actually volunteered to reach out to our pharmacy department and see if they can get hold of or set up a conversation between us and our PBM to explain that, "Hey, I know that you haven't sent us the formulary in the past, now we need it to fulfill a CMS mandate." So that felt good. That was nice. I didn't wait for it to build up. I didn't, even though it's a past frustration that I have been really irritated with during PBM conversions and implementations in the past, because that's a significant piece of information that makes it difficult for us to report on all kinds of stuff like tier activity, specialty drugs, all those kinds of things as they change. We also had a meeting on our provider deep dive. The meeting was a very wide audience all the way from analysts up to directors. That is an environment that I'm not super comfortable speaking up in, for a multitude of reasons. But today, I twice during the meeting, I recognized something that somebody was reflecting in correctly. I stopped the meeting, identified what the difference was, and explained sort of my viewpoint on that thing. Not necessarily as a "hey, you're wrong and I'm right," but as "from my perspective, these are the important points in that category." That one over really well, too. That was it sparked a good discussion wasn't a long discussion, just a few minutes. And that disagree everybody understood what I was talking about, and the discussion moved on and it turned out to be really smooth. So as long as I pick the right way to present that information, which is kind of what stresses me out when I'm bringing things up (both the conflict and "how do I present my point of view without causing concern or them being upset") is always the fear. And that was a success. So, fear unjustified, crisis never happened.
