# delegation
Made a list of tasks that I have on my plate that should actually be delegated to someone else. Created a delegation log in the docs folder. Started delegation log for October. I'm gonna put that into my meeting or note summarizer query so that I can have delegation tasks and follow up pop up on my status reports. I delegated the repo branch protections to Sean Trent, and delegated fixing the member consecutive coverage model issues to the data extracts team, probably Brad, or Amith. I left that up to Carl. Not that good at delegating, but I'm trying to get better. I'm taking notes on how delegation makes me feel and what the actual outcomes are to try to get over some of my anxiety with assigning things to other people. 

# Architecture group discussion. 
This is an informal meeting with Enterprise Architecture and Solution Architects across the IT department. We discussed some diagramming techniques. We discussed a few specific architecture problems, and talked about aligning the way we diagram things with the business and with our data modeling, and sort of reinforced my thought that I need to try and connect my data modeling and the concepts in domain-driven design and the concepts in C4 modeling or diagramming into sort of one cohesive way to represent our data in a context that the business can understand. I need to find a way in Lucidchart to express that. So I would love a way in Lucidchart to have a C1 diagram that you can click on a portion of and drill into a C2 and then to C3 and C4. That'd be really cool. I'm not sure how to pull that off in Lucidchart, so I need to do a little research.

# Snowflake Access Policies - Collaboration 
Met with Jesse Ahern, Tina Ranga, James Seeger, and Shreyas Thakkar to discuss our row access policies and how those things are going to affect the OneView app and how those things are going to be implemented. I think it was a good discussion. I think we came out of it with some good perspective on how that whole system is going to work. I do not think I had any action items. I do not remember. 

# Other work
I worked on defining my modeling strategy by documenting some business processes. I did a couple of brain dumps on things that I need to go back and analyze with the hope of producing some documentation that will help with transferring work to managed service partners and just continuing with pushing my data modeling for the provider, member, and product domains along as much as I can as we prepare to engage with our business councils to drive out the nitty-gritty of what they need to support those business functions. For now, I'm working on foundational stuff, which in data modeling terms translates to the raw vault, which is very scripted and template-driven. And so it's something we can continue working on. In the meantime, data governance is going to work with the business to drive out some pain points, business rules, and use cases that we can try to solve for them using these raw ingredients in the raw vault to assemble the dishes they want. If you want to use the restaurant analogy for our data pipelines.
