# BCBSA meeting on the Blue Provider Directory (BPD) data via a Snowflake share. 
Met with representatives from BCPSA and discussed the possibility of getting the Blues Provider Directory information via a Snowflake share and getting enough information to leverage it for analytical use cases. They seemed pretty open to the idea. They were going to take it back and discuss it, and they did mention that other Blue plans are also interested in this.
