2025-1009 - BCI Discover #3 (Interop and EDP) Data Sources ObjectivesContinue discovery of data sources for EDP and Interop.Clarify scope and prerequisites for CMS mandates (9115 and 0057).Discuss historical data availability and ingestion strategies.Identify gaps and plan next steps for connector design and data modeling.Key Topics & DecisionsFacets & Gemstone Data ScopeFocused on medical claims, membership, and provider data.Dental claims exist in facets but are scoped for 2026, not 2025.Gemstone data starts in 2022, with migration completed in 2024.Legacy data goes back to 2016, with archival ingestion required. This can be used as a crosswalk. Membership CrosswalkExists between legacy and gemstone systems.Used for continuous coverage, clinical tracking, and member outreach.Crosswalk data in the legacy source table will be in bronze layer, and these data elements will not be promoted to silver member FM models.Broker DataPresent in both legacy and gemstone facets.Covers Individual and group membershipsComplex structure: primary/secondary brokers, consultants, commissions.Decision: Treat as separate domain, prioritize for 2026, not 2025.Formulary Data ChallengesCarelon and CVS do not provide regular feeds; only spreadsheets.Formulary data at BCI is not provided in a standard format, but available upon request. Interop requires Claims, formulary, and Provider directoryAction: BCI Compliance team to confirm if Formulary data is needed for CMS compliance and take steps needed to establish data availability for CMS compliance. (Dominic/Dan B) Action: Historical formulary data may not be available; compliance team to assess the impact. (Dan B)RX Claims HistoryCarelon data is available from 2022.CVS/Caremark Rx data exists in on-prem databases, possibly back to 2010.Extracting Rx data from on-prem data will be in different format,  likely to need a separate connector.s3://abacus-bcidaho-landing-prd-028341391344-us-east-1 - where Rx data is postedAction: Rx Claim Carelon history, evaluate completeness and compliance relevance of historical RX claims.CVS/Caremark data in DB, initial data files received. The data will require mapping. Not all fields were represented.  Over time, the field mapping has changed. Action: CVS Caremark Rx Claims: Rich Tallon to confirm if this is required for compliance and if there is no possibility of compliance impact vs getting that data.Action: CVS Caremark Rx Claims: mapping can by shared by Dan B.  Pharmacy Dispensed  Pharmacy Fulfilled Rx (Clinical Event - medical dispense): this is not a required source for  9115 or EDPSimplr Data (Provider Credentialing)Includes education, licenses, board certifications, languages, and affiliations.Delivered via Parquet files in S3.Used for provider directory API; no historical data needed.Provider education, licenses, board certifications, language, and hospital admitting privileges9115 - requires:onyx_provider_organization   onyx_provider_practitioner   onyx_provider_location   onyx_provider_practitioner_role   This information is available In the Qualification section (all info on practitioner)Provider location details come from FacetsNPI links the provider from Facets to SimplrRich Tallon can provide queries to pull pertinent data if neededAction: the BCI simplr files (format to be confirmed). BCI to confirm format of data to be set to Abacus (Kelly to confirm the structure and format of the date)No history is required. Sensitivity Tagging & Tenant IDRequired for row-level security and column-level masking.Tags maintained in Snowflake metadata.Action: Data governance team to confirm expectations and delivery method. (Dan B)Action: Abacus Implementation to confirm if data is accessible direct from snowflake tables. (Valli P)Facets RDM TablesUsed for code translations and standardization.Includes data dictionary, master code translation tables, and user-defined values.Action: Provide mappings and descriptions for FM model standardization.
