TranscriptOctober 15, 2025, 3:10PMLorraine Maldonado started transcriptionLorraine Maldonado   0:04Get started. Thanks for joining everyone.   0:07OK.OK.Lorraine Maldonado   0:16And Dale's on a big deal.Sathish Dhanasekar   0:17Hey everybody, we're meeting again.So I want to catch up on the remaining sources today. I want to start. I want to start with the. Now we discussed this particular custom tables today about the gemstone and facets we have today. I want to go deeper dive into it specifically.I'll give you what our previous. I'll give you an overview what we discussed previously. This is a custom table in the in the facets as well as in the both in both the legacy and general facets database.This has an additional information, additional payment information that today we cannot accommodate in the facet state, right? So for example, it has complete payment transaction of a given claim void versus.All the adjustments accounted for the claim within for each of those claim what was paid before and if there is any voided and there was transaction. One of the main point it came out was we are maintain BCA maintenance is stable because.Today, facets cannot create a negative claim scenario like claims without void claim scenario in facets. Is that is my assumption right?+12*******42   1:43Yeah, that's correct.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:45OK and.So do we need to be concerned? So if I have a claim in facets and we just to our claim claim item data model and after so it it I'm creating this more of a submitted claim.Then the adjusted claim, right? So I I see that as OK facets. This is an adjudicated claim and this table would more look like in submitted claim, right? We would have additional fee, additional set of values.Then what is already captured in that in the facets. So when we're creating a white claim here, I'm assuming that the claim IDs here will be same as the one we have in the facets, correct?+12*******42   2:24OK.Yes, yes.Sathish Dhanasekar   2:39So if you are creating a void claims here, how does that claim would exist? There would not be any claim such claim exist in the assets.+12*******42   2:50There wouldn't be A - claim with those with those exact attributes in facets, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   2:57But there will be a claim, so.+12*******42   2:57So as so the claim ID and the line number and then they add another piece to the composite key for those for those paid claim tables which IS the I think they call - IT current prior indicator. So - IT just means whether it's the reversal or the.Original plan.And then for every claim that gets adjusted, you'll have A - negative transaction that reverses the prior claim and then A - new current transaction that states the current state of the claim.3.In fact, that you can always get that just by looking at the current version of the claim, like the latest suffix of the claim.But.It's instead of calculating that, we have created A - table that's populated by claims processing batches, the adjudication batches as those claims get adjudicated so that we have A - hard record of exactly what was adjudicated.And how and what the amounts were and so on. And then that's the reference the accounting uses to to make GL entries. It's the reference that we use to send out the OBS. It's the it's the grain. It controls the grain of most of our Analytics on claims.You know, we get attributes from other claims tables inside of facets. This kind of controls the the granularity of our claims - Data for analytics.Just because we need those negative transactions assigned to the right pay date.Anyway, I don't know if all that makes sense, but that's it. It's not too big of A - deal, except that it's sort of, it's just so central to A - lot of the processes that we have that it's kind of our system of record for for claims payment.Does that make sense?Sathish Dhanasekar   5:03Yeah, so I I'm trying to fit in whether we need to.It makes sense. So you you have A - specific use case for this too. If you're running A - payment integrity on A - holistic claim, this table would be used but but wouldn't you be able to generate but when coming to you will be.So those wide.+12*******42   5:26You could, yeah, you could take the, you could take the information in facets and generate the information you need. We have been unsuccessful in getting that to match in the past.Sathish Dhanasekar   5:34That body will be.+12*******42   5:39In in being able to match all the activity in this table, it's been difficult to recreate - IT from the facets records, so it's much, much easier to just use this table to drag the grain of whatever you're doing.And what this enables, at least for our analytical use cases, IS claims analysis both by paid date or by incurred date. So incurred basis or paid basis claims analysis can happen out of this transaction history, this payment history.Because the reversal has to be put in the same on the same date as the new claim rather than the old claim. You know what I mean to get the financial impact right and facets does not do that. The the paid - Data in facets IS not.Sathish Dhanasekar   6:15OK, incur that is.+12*******42   6:31The pay date. It's the pay date of the original, not the. Yeah, it's the pay date of the original claim, not of the adjusted version of the claim. So you need A - version of the claim that's A - negative of the original claim, but that had the same pay date as the.Sathish Dhanasekar   6:32It's a. It's A - finalized date, basically.+12*******42   6:47Adjustment.Sathish Dhanasekar   6:52OK, so you you pay that wide and I just.+12*******42   6:53So that that so that reversal and adjustment happens at the same time financially.Sathish Dhanasekar   6:57Same time, yeah, yeah, makes sense. So you'll take the reverse from the.+12*******42   6:59Yeah. So you get the net effect of the adjustment in in it. If you want A - GL sense or A - or A - paid basis analysis, you get the financial impact of the claim on that date, the net impact when you when you combine the reversal plus the new claim.If that makes sense.Sathish Dhanasekar   7:22OK.So this IS to track.Uh, custom table that you're tracking.So do A - proper payment and you don't overpay because of the interest and penalty based on the original original pay date instead based on you reverse - IT today and then if you pay the adjustment today you.Technically don't.Incur the penalty because the payday is.+12*******42   7:57Yeah. So if there was $100 claim in January and then this month - IT got adjusted to $150.00 claim, the net impact in October would be $25, but the new claim IS for $150.00. You know what I mean?Sathish Dhanasekar   8:06Mhm.+12*******42   8:15The new claim created in in October IS says $150.00 but then but the difference between the financial impact of that claim IS the difference between the two, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   8:15Mhm.Good to know.Two $50.OK and.+12*******42   8:32So that's what - IT enables on the analytic side and then they do some EOB and payment integrity kind of stuff on the on the operational side.Sathish Dhanasekar   8:41But wouldn't you be? So if if the difference IS the I'm asking all these questions down because would - IT make sense to put - IT in the claim model itself? Because we would already be populating this particular claim from the facet source to our claim model, right? And then what?Do we need to? On top of that, do we need to ingest this claim into the same claim model, which would mean from the same?+12*******42   9:07Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying, but.In theory, you can back into - IT from the fastest data, like you can transform the fastest - Data and get this answer. We haven't been able to match - IT to accounting when we do - IT that way, so there must be some variance in the way that the claims batch works and how - IT does its calculations.Sathish Dhanasekar   9:24So.+12*******42   9:32And so in the past, maybe it's been different. So to get historically accurate numbers, we've had to go to this table.If you want to try to recreate - IT from the facets data, you can. UmmBut because it's been A - few years, OK, it's up to you guys how you leverage this in your in your output, like in your silver and gold, if you want to treat - IT as just A - source.Sathish Dhanasekar   9:50No, we we can we can still load this we.So sorry, the police should talk then.+12*******42   10:05Cable and that's where it stops, then then we will definitely need it for all of our for a lot of our claims data pipelines.Sathish Dhanasekar   10:14Oh, out of that is goes without a question. We definitely have to ingest into the source and to the Bronx. My these questions are asked would it make sense to operate our foundation model would serve any purpose of is it because it's technically a new version of the plane.But the only difference between the facets claim and this claim is like even though it's adjustment claim is $150.00, you're still going to that another $50 claim will still exist the facets, correct?+12*******42   10:35OK.Yeah. So both of existing facets. So you would just need to only use the current version of the claim to measure the financial impact of the claim. And unless you go through the transformation steps, you wouldn't be able to do paid basis claims analysis, you'd only be able to do incurred basis.Sathish Dhanasekar   10:47Right, so the.Play score.   11:04Yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   11:07Yeah, so the question I have here is that the the reverse amount or the adjusted amount that will be going to be reflected in the facets or not. I just want to confirm that because since the separate table has been created it if if it it can be get tracked in the facets.Sathish Dhanasekar   11:15Yeah.+12*******42   11:18Yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   11:22Then in that case we have to check through the claim item.+12*******42   11:24No, in in facets, in facets you do have to do some transformations to get the negative claim, the reversal. So the only the positive claims are there. So you have a claim number that ends in 00. That's the original claim. If it gets reversed, then you create a new version of that claim.A different claim ID that ends in 01 and so on. As you keep adjusting the claim, the that suffix keeps incrementing the last two digits of the claim ID. So they each get new claim ID's and they have an adjusted from and an adjusted to reference on the claim.And they have a paid date on the new claim and an an incurred date and a paid date on the old claim and an incurred date. The negative transaction needs the adjusted paid paid date.Um.So you have to do a little bit of calculation. So you have to look up the the claim it was adjusted from and the claim it was adjusted to to understand where the claim come from, came from and then create the negative transaction and sometimes claims are split so the same claim ID.Has suffixes that sort of leapfrog each other. So they take one claim, make it into two, but they both have the same claim ID, claim root ID and then the last two, the last two characters of the claim ID are different and then they increment independently so.Nilesh Trivedi   12:43Mhm.+12*******42   12:56Adjustment claim claim 03 could be adjusted from claim 01, but claim 04 could be adjusted from claim 02 if they split it and so they don't necessarily have to.Nilesh Trivedi   12:57Um.+12*******42   13:11Follow that pattern, but as long as you follow the adjusted from and adjusted to links that are on the claim, in theory you can recreate, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   13:19You will get the ride.Nilesh Trivedi   13:21So this custom table provide this all this information which has been from.Sathish Dhanasekar   13:22Clever.+12*******42   13:23We just, we haven't been able to make that. We haven't been able to make that in theory thing work in the past for historical claims because they changed the way those claims batch thing rights. And so it's been really valuable to have the record of what it what actually came out of the claim.Sathish Dhanasekar   13:24No, no, no. This is not about the customer.Nilesh Trivedi   13:27OK.OK.+12*******42   13:43Adjustment batch or adjudication batch.Sathish Dhanasekar   13:49OK, uh, so let let.+12*******42   13:50So I recommend having it, but you can recreate it.It's just messy.Sathish Dhanasekar   14:03So let's run a scenario, right? Dan, let's me let me see if my understanding is right by scenario, right? Have a claim 0 and said 1.1 dash 0000, right? That's our original claim.When when you need to adjust a claim, you would have to create a reversal claim and adjustment claim and say that 100 paid up for argument's sake $2000, right? And then if I create a void claim, there would be one.+12*******42   14:33Mhm.Sathish Dhanasekar   14:3501 It would. It would not classified as a void. It's more of a is that an indicator within the for the reversal. It's a new claim. It's a new claim.+12*******42   14:42No, it's just a new claim. No, it's not a void. It's not a void. It's just a new claim.Sathish Dhanasekar   14:48New claim, but how do we know this is taking a reward?+12*******42   14:49There's no void.There's no void on the new claim. It says it was adjusted from this previous claim. So you could so you could go look at the claim adjusted from link which gives you the claim idea of the of the previous claim and then you go look at that claim and calculate the difference between the two and.Sathish Dhanasekar   14:54Yeah.Registered from. Thanks.Mhm.Mhm.+12*******42   15:11And calculate the paid, the correct paid date for the adjustment, and then you're in theory good. But when we've tried to do that in the past, it has not worked exactly. It's been close, but we haven't been able to match accounting's numbers for historical claims now.That was several years ago and so maybe it would work now. Like our processes have gotten cleaner and so on, more predictable and less changes. So maybe if we look through the last seven years, you could replicate it, but it'd be.But anyway, 'cause it's frustrating because in theory it's possible, but in practice it has proved to be too messy to get accurate to be accurate to the penny.And that's one of the requirements for some of our analytical data that are balanced out to accounting.Sathish Dhanasekar   16:05Oh.OK, so I'm trying to get to a path like.Trying to get the contact between these two data set between FASS original and this one. So I I know you said the FASS doesn't do void claim, but the void claim that's in the custom table would have as would represent.Would be there the facets that some claim, right? The claim ID would still exist in the facets claim. Yeah, right. So that that.+12*******42   16:32Yeah, yeah, yeah. It basically looks like the original claim with negative numbers, right? The the reversal most in facets, there's no negative numbers. But in this custom table, in this custom table, there's a version of the original claim with negative numbers basically.Sathish Dhanasekar   16:39In the facets.The facets of.Negative numbers.Yes, so that's.+12*******42   16:52You do have to get the pay date and a couple of pieces of information from the claim it was adjusted to, as well as the claim it was adjusted from, if that makes sense. So you do have to do some calculation. You have to join back to the claim table a couple of times to get all the information you need, and then in theory you can create the different.Sathish Dhanasekar   17:02Um.+12*******42   17:12Yourself with the transformation. But like I said, it's massive because of split claims. Yeah, there there's some interesting logic in there. And then even when we have done that.Sathish Dhanasekar   17:17That's.+12*******42   17:28It hasn't matched accounting's record of the claim payment.Sathish Dhanasekar   17:31Yeah, that's that's the second order, right. But what I'm trying to is a lineage between these two. So that's why I want to run the scenario in my head with you. So if my understanding of the how the relation between this would play out, the lineage between this would work out right if the the the original.+12*******42   17:36Yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   17:45OK.+12*******42   17:51Um.Sathish Dhanasekar   17:52So origination of the claim information is always gonna be facets. You have original claim 100 claim ID which is had $2000. You would need now you would need to reverse and adjust this claim right? Then you would create one more adjustment, one more claim in facets which is 101.+12*******42   17:58OK.Mhm.Sathish Dhanasekar   18:11Which would still have the same $2000 amount. It would say as an adjusted claim and it would have proper adjustment to an link and you'd have one more claim that would K 102 which is also gonna adjust. So in this case we're adjusting to instead of $2000 we're.+12*******42   18:26OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   18:29So we're only paying $1500 or $2500, whatever it is, right? So let's take we are paying more $2500. Give me one minute, OK?+12*******42   18:34Yeah, so.That's not quite what happened with that one.In facets you would go from the 100 claim for $2000 to a 02 to a 01 claim for $2500. There wouldn't be a reversal suffix in there.Sathish Dhanasekar   18:47Mhm.OK, but you said that's just two claims in the facets. OK, so one positive claim that is. So you will have one original claim and only an adjustment one will have only adjustment claim in the facets, correct?+12*******42   18:57There's just two claims now. It's it's one positive claim and another positive claim, yeah.Good adjustment. Yep. And they're both positive. Yep. Or they're both absolute value information, right? They're just amounts.Sathish Dhanasekar   19:12OK, both positive.Yes, depending on the current time of the adjustment of pricing, whatever changed and then the new claim represents based on the adjust new at that point registered time which is a $2500 right now coming back to this particular custom table would have the reversal of the original claim.+12*******42   19:28Yep.Sathish Dhanasekar   19:35But you said the reversal claim that we create in the in the custom table will always have the reference back in the facets table, right? But if you don't have a entry, so does it mean in the in the custom table?+12*******42   19:45Chris, Yep.Sathish Dhanasekar   19:51You would have two claims with 1011 for reversal, one for one for adjustment with the same claim ID. Is that right?Both of.Mhm.+12*******42   20:08So there would be a in in your example, the 100, the 100 claim for $2000 would have a 100 claim in the custom table as well, and it would have a current prior indicator of P.Sathish Dhanasekar   20:14Mhm.Mhm.+12*******42   20:23Instead of a C, the first one would have a C and the second, the second instance of the 100 claim would have a P and it would be negative values. And then there would be a 101 claim positive values and that would be it.Sathish Dhanasekar   20:23Mhm.+12*******42   20:38And then if it got adjusted again, there would be another 101 claim with the with the current prior indicator B and then there would be a 102 claim with the new amount.Sathish Dhanasekar   20:44OK.OK, so when when we need the reversal adjustment, the original claim 100 will have another entry 100 in the custom table but with the with the what you said that the indicator is P prior adjustment indicator would be P indicate that it's it's a reversal reversal claim.+12*******42   21:04Yeah, PU.Sathish Dhanasekar   21:09And the original claim, the prior adjustment indicator would you would had it as a C because indicating the original claim and the new under claim in the custom table would be prior adjustment indicator would be P indicating it's a reversal claim and then you would have an adjustment claim 101 in the custom table.+12*******42   21:16Mhm.Sathish Dhanasekar   21:26And I'm assuming it would have C or P.+12*******42   21:30Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   21:32The the the 101 would claim would have C.+12*******42   21:33Yep. And that just continues over the cleaning district.Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   21:38OK, so this is 2 basically. OK, so this.So Rilesh, I'm thinking for our specific use case EDP we would not need this claim.Because the void claim.For EOB we're not generating a payment balancing for interop and we could just keep this data in the source in the bronze. We don't have to write it there because the only difference between there from table here and there is the.Nilesh Trivedi   22:06And.Sathish Dhanasekar   22:15Why the claim with the same claim ID were to be a negative value, but other than that it's technically the same claim. This is for just for the the payment balancing that you guys are using this table to track.+12*******42   22:24Yes.Correct. Yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   22:30So, so reversal amount if we can track through the assets that that would be good.Sathish Dhanasekar   22:34So I'll I'll, I'll run the scenario with you, right. Yeah. So we have original claim in the facts table claim ID 100 and the net amount on that say $2000 and when we adjust the claim, there is no concept of negative or wide claim in the facet. So we could simply adjustment claim which is 101.And it would have say $2500 but in the custom table you would have you would have two original claims. The first original claim would have adjustment indicator would say C indicating it's original claim.Which 100 and same $2000 the same claim ID 100 would exist in the custom table but all the values would be negative reverse to a negative value and would would be minus $2000 and the Kappa adjustment indicator indicator would be P.Giving that's a negative claim and the new adjustment claim will also exist in this table. 101 would have the new amount $2500 of positive claim. Adjustment prior indicator would be in this case C considering it's a original to the.+12*******42   23:45OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   23:47It's kind of original claim that Dale.Nilesh Trivedi   23:50So my my so my simple question here Satish is that in that case for EOB interop we have to consider only the indicator C while checking the claim EOB. Am I right?Sathish Dhanasekar   24:05Right, because end of the day for you will be you're saying whether what we paid the claim. If we denied any claim service on the as part of the claim, we would have to explain why our if we paid the claim, we have to explain the benefits what we paid off the claim and what we don't right. We this why the claim that exists in the.Nilesh Trivedi   24:06So.Sathish Dhanasekar   24:24In the in the custom table, it's way of just balancing to take the payment or and create a new payment. It does not contribute anything specific to EOB. It may contribute to the EOP which which is not the scope of.Uh, interrupt. I don't think it's having any contribution to UOB itself.Nilesh Trivedi   24:46Yeah. So in drop it, it has a EOB where we need the payment integrity, but as you confirm that we can have that through the facets and if we can get that through the facets with the indicator C that is already the adjusted data, whatever it is, then in that case it will be good.Sathish Dhanasekar   25:05So when when you so typically we are just a claim based on the providers.Please and then we get that just one claim.We generally don't the new registered claim. So if you're sending an EOB, the scenarios I've seen, OK, so I I I paid a claim $2000 for some of the reason for one line I denied it for $500 and then say the member comes back and raises a dispute. Hey.+12*******42   25:35Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   25:36I should be covered and then for some reason we decide OK to honor that $500 and then we repay the claim. But in the we will create a new adjustment claim that will cover increase the payment to $2000 including the $500 amount and in that case.+12*******42   25:37OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   25:52Yes, then in the you will be.Nilesh Trivedi   25:56It should be reflected.Sathish Dhanasekar   25:57We only reported, yeah, it should be reflected. Now the new claim would then the member would get a new. You will be setting that OK, this is a claim ID we paid for this claim and this is a new amount reflected. Then it'd be OK, but we never need to report. OK, we took out the payment because to.Do a provided balancing. Yeah, I don't think we need that for EOB, OK.Nilesh Trivedi   26:20Yes, yes.+12*******42   26:21So my understanding, I haven't done a lot of EOB work. So EOB as in Echo, Oscar, Bravo.Sathish Dhanasekar   26:29Yes.+12*******42   26:30The I have not done a lot of that, but my understanding is that this custom table is where the EOB's are printed from.So this is the basis for the EO B's that get sent out, but that's just my understanding. We can confirm that, but my where I was going with that is you might have trouble matching the EO B's that have already been sent if you.Sathish Dhanasekar   26:44Right.The.Mhm.+12*******42   26:53Do it without this table unless you can really replicate that. But I know for payment we can't replicate it and so I I hesitate to commit that, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   27:01Right, it makes it. It makes us a payment because now you want to balance it out, right? So if if I pay the provider, so if you if I sum all this payment without a negative without the void payment then you end up showing UOP.+12*******42   27:09Yeah, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   27:17You would have paid a provider $2500, right? And if I doesn't include that negative payment, then if you balance that claim, it would look like without any adjustment indicator, it simply would look like $4500 without the void payment. I I I definitely get that.+12*******42   27:21Yep.Yeah, that makes sense for explanation of payment, but explanation of benefits. My understanding is it comes from this table as well.Sathish Dhanasekar   27:35Exploration of penance.+12*******42   27:43The EOB stuff.Sathish Dhanasekar   27:46OK.+12*******42   27:47That they print the explanation of benefits based on the information in this table rather than the information in the court tables.Sathish Dhanasekar   27:52Yeah, but then yes, the explanation of benefits to the service to the claim, right. So I for I think we can we can generate an EOB based sort of the facets table itself maybe the the BCI process built in built in a way that it you always look at this tables.+12*******42   28:052.Yeah, you totally can.Sathish Dhanasekar   28:11Since you're considering this a final kind of paid version of the cable, so you always looked at it. But I think if if if you purely look from the UOB lens, the facets data alone is enough and we can keep these two tables, the custom tables, we can ingest it in the bronze.+12*******42   28:26Could be, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   28:30And we can say if you're building a specific payment integrity use case scenario down the line, then at that point you could use this to data to directly join from the bronze against that particular claims table to get any specific use cases.I think in my mind, I think it we would interest it. We'll keep it in the source, these custom tables in the bronze layer itself.+12*******42   28:47OK.OK.OK. Yeah, if it if it doesn't work out, we can get a meeting with the folks who support that batch process and we can and we can go through the code with them if you want and and we can go through some of the downstream processes if we need to.Sathish Dhanasekar   29:02Yeah, but that's always, yeah, yeah.Yeah.Yeah.+12*******42   29:12So we can take it. We can put a microscope on it if we need to. We have all the resources to do that if you want.Sathish Dhanasekar   29:19Yeah.+12*******42   29:19But otherwise I I mean my my selfishly my concern is that I have it available in a bronze layer and so and I'm good.Sathish Dhanasekar   29:28Yeah, it would be available in the bronze layer.Yeah, thanks for that detail. So just so OK.No.I'm creating my version of the notes, not relying them. Yeah, it's sometimes taking some time.Negative version of version of claim.Custom tables negative original original claim is created over the same claim as original claim claim ideas. What differentiate these two claims?Clean fees.I just want indicator.Oh, playing both has.Will be see.And the word lame.Will be.B.OK.So keep this source in the bronze and roll not rate rate.Will not right wait.Um.You can.You will be in proper schools.Explain.So much.I am not.21.Thank you. OK. I think we scored the major one. I thought it was going to take a longer to understand. Good.So on the let's move on to the. So I I think we covered everything right Dan. I I don't think we pretty much covered everything. So I don't think we have anything any more detail to discuss on this. So if you're good, we can move to the next set of sources.+12*******42   34:59Yeah, let's move on.Sathish Dhanasekar   35:00OK, awesome. So Oh yeah, I just need to, I just want to confirm the I we flagged it as a flat data eliminated and we'll be getting the S3 for it, right. The structure, this is all that we're gonna receive it.The flood in the flood data in delimiter format, probably CSV, right?+12*******42   35:25Yeah, that should be uniform, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   35:26Who in?Yeah, OK.And on box status.Hand addition.OK, I need to try.+12*******42   35:59Store.Sathish Dhanasekar   36:00OK.OK, the episodes. So currently we are ingesting this data set for suspect and so we are ingesting episodes better to intelligence.+12*******42   36:27It.Sathish Dhanasekar   36:33And I believe at from men.+12*******42   36:35Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   36:39Adverment but we are ingesting only for suspect condition and condition clinical data. While this is not need this also not considered for interop 915 but for EDP.Beyond this condition and suspect condition data, do we need to account for additional data point data sets from these three sources?+12*******42   37:13This is Dan. I'm not familiar with those resources, so anybody else on the call familiar with those?Kelly Good Clark   37:21So builder with Sean Smith who who is gone now. I invited Tamara Hess but she is out this morning and and maybe she should forward this to her team and and I I don't think that anyone on our team would actually be familiar either.I'm going to i'm going to write these down. I'll find out who we need to talk to on these. They did have Sean's position posted. I don't know if if it's held or not, but I'll I'll find out who we need to talk to. I thinkI'll talk to the director over there and find out who we want to work with on those and and Edge as well. I don't know if line 26 with Edge is also going to be a Tamara hat or maybe not just a Tamara hat, but a handful of people over there.+12*******42   38:14Yeah, I am familiar with the edge process that's on Prem and but but maybe, but Tamara would probably be more familiar with the business requirements up to date because it was a few years ago that I worked on that.Sathish Dhanasekar   38:15Yes.Kelly Good Clark   38:15And then 27. Oh, OK, OK.+12*******42   38:29But I am familiar with the overall process.Sathish Dhanasekar   38:44OK so OK so currently we are interesting edge as only a source only data. I think for current this adjustment as part of this adjustment project we've done in the past.So.Is uh, do we have any specific?+12*******42   39:11So we have, we have a process on Prem that prepares the data and submits it to the edge server for our submissions and then we have the consumption side where we're pulling data from the edge server to do.Sathish Dhanasekar   39:20Mm-hmm.+12*******42   39:26To do things validation and analytics. So which part of that?Is our interop with you guys? Is it supposed to be both, both the preparation of the data and the consumption of the data, or is it just the consumption?Sathish Dhanasekar   39:41This one.Wally, if you're on the call, quick question.+12*******42   39:50I don't know what's in soap for you guys.Vallimala Palaneeappan   39:50I I just joined Satish.Sathish Dhanasekar   39:54So this OK, so I'm just briefing this edge data. I I see that we are interesting as part of the risk data, right? Today it's only a source only data as part of the risk. So what do we use this? What type of data is that this edge is like is it?Clinical.OK.Vallimala Palaneeappan   40:16Um.Sathish Dhanasekar   40:16OK.+12*******42   40:16OK.Vallimala Palaneeappan   40:18Yeah.And these are all the source only. We are not mapping it into RFMS.Sathish Dhanasekar   40:22So what?OK, so do we know what type of data is set to? So let's let's ask, let's.Vallimala Palaneeappan   40:37Oh, um.Sagar Shah   40:39So, so this is.Vallimala Palaneeappan   40:39They could be anything from enrollment to claim or any supplemental claim. So there are 700 + 2 files. Yeah, they could be, yes.Sagar Shah   40:42Yeah.+12*******42   40:44OK.It does.It does include pharmacy claim. It doesn't include pharmacy claim, which is not part of the fastest data.Vallimala Palaneeappan   40:56Um, I am not too sure about it. Um.+12*******42   41:01Well, when we when we submit the data, so I've worked on the submission part, so I know that we submit membership and premium and medical claims and pharmacy claims.Sathish Dhanasekar   41:13Mhm.+12*******42   41:14To the edge server, kind of if you want to talk about the domains, um.Vallimala Palaneeappan   41:20Looking at the table list, I do see pharmacy and the table names, so it could include pharmacy claims as well, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   41:35So if if if you are submitting the membership, membership and the claim and the policy claim information to the edge and then we are extracting the edge, what does exactly H does because we're we're kind of getting the same data that we are submitting them.What additional processing it does? Additional data contacts it provides?+12*******42   41:57Yeah. So they calculate CMS gives us back what they accepted of from our submission and what is wrong with our submission if anything and.And the validation kind of information. So we we use the incoming data for validation and certifying our data feed.Sathish Dhanasekar   42:23Oh, so it's OK.+12*******42   42:23And then I don't know what they do with it afterwards, but I think that there's a risk number that comes out of the process and a couple other things about each member. Now and and the edge server is just our QHP population, so it's a pretty narrow population.But in theory, other than those risk numbers, I don't know what else you would need that's not in facets and pharmacy claims.Sathish Dhanasekar   42:43OK.+12*******42   42:54But I I don't know. Tamara would know a lot better what they do with the edge data after it's on the edge server.Sathish Dhanasekar   43:03OK.+12*******42   43:04So if you're just talking about consuming from the edge server, then that's a camera question to get all the details you need.Sathish Dhanasekar   43:14Yeah, it's for.+12*******42   43:14And Tamara's out this week, but we can talk to her next week about the about both of those things, some of the CMS.Kelly Good Clark   43:21I think she'll be here tomorrow, Dan. So I'm forwarding the invite for her for tomorrow and and I'm I'm copying Rhett because Rhett is her boss because like I said, this was formerly Sean. Some of this was formerly Sean Smith's area, so.+12*******42   43:21And it should be.Sathish Dhanasekar   43:21OK, so.+12*******42   43:23Oh.Oh, cool.Yeah, it was under government programs and then they moved the technical part to HCE. So anyway, I'm not sure who owns it now.Kelly Good Clark   43:37Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   43:48OK.OK, so this more like certain encounter reporting data. So you submit this membership claims and pharmacy claims back to them and then they come back with other.Kind of risk adjustment score or probably whether we accept it or not. So this we can we can discuss more when the Assembly for this comes back, but I based on what you described.+12*******42   44:161.Sathish Dhanasekar   44:22Then this mode looks more like a snow socially. That's how I think we kept it before, so unless we.It's the same claims, same pharmacy claims that it's it's the same sort of pharmacy claims, right, that we already have coming from Carolina RX. So it's nothing new.+12*******42   44:41Correct. Yeah. Nope.Sathish Dhanasekar   44:43Yep. Mm OK.+12*******42   44:46We just have to present the data in CMS format to them. So that that creates a lot of transformation, but the base data is is just what's in facets in those pharmacy clients.Sathish Dhanasekar   44:49CMS Palmer.Yes.+12*******42   45:01And our prior submission and so on, we have to compare to what they already have and and submit adjustments like a differential file. Um.But if you're not worried about the input, like the like the creating of the data to send out to CMS, then and you're just talking about ingestion, then that's a lot simpler. I just don't know all of the uses of that as sugar data that Tamara could speak to.Yeah.So probably the next line, 27, that's probably a Tamara question as well. Maybe we have people on the phone who could speak to some of the CMS inbound files.Kelly Good Clark   45:52I think they are potentially already receiving everything listed on line 27, so that that may already be done. I could be wrong, but.Sathish Dhanasekar   46:07We we are receiving MORI believe one minute.Kelly Good Clark   46:07I believe wine.Sathish Dhanasekar   46:15I.So yes, we are selling MOR today.And we are populating in FM specific for MOR. So I so we're not assuming this MOA2MO4MO2 or is it the same as MOR also different formatters. So I I don't have much insight into this particular data type.+12*******42   46:24Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   46:44Can anyone? So we have we don't. The person who can speak to it will only be available tomorrow. So Wally, we don't just MOE to MO for TRR, right?Vallimala Palaneeappan   46:56Yeah, those are all CMS files. I think we should be good there. We have the data dictionaries available on the CMS.Sathish Dhanasekar   47:06Right. But we are not adjusting those today, correct?Vallimala Palaneeappan   47:09No, we are. Um.Sathish Dhanasekar   47:10OBR.Vallimala Palaneeappan   47:11MOR. Yes. TRR. No. Yeah, TRR. No, not yet.Sathish Dhanasekar   47:13Demoria.Vallimala Palaneeappan   47:19MO8MAO2 and O4? Yes, just not the TRR.Sathish Dhanasekar   48:03But we are. We're not updating any FM models for this, right? So this would mean the MOA 2 and Nemo 4 is just source only.OK, well, we can discuss this internally.Vallimala Palaneeappan   48:18Yeah, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   48:31OK, so the reference data set for this one I think we are.Um.So once so for the 30th Kelly, we probably confirm it tomorrow because if if you guys are sending, we are not ingesting today. So then at that point we just have to confirm whether it's already been sent to S3 location which is not ingesting. So maybe.If that is the case, you guys don't have to do anything. We just have to consume from the beginning. Other than that, if it's or if it's not been sent, we'll have to start the ingestion if it's needed.Kelly Good Clark   49:14It is being Trr is being replicated to. Um, they're not using it. I don't know, but it is being replicated, and i'll give you the landing budget for T. R. UmmAnd.And you're going to want to search on this.You might want to search on CMS CRR, but it does look like it's being replicated to you. Whether or not you're using it, I don't know.Sathish Dhanasekar   50:05OK.OK.Thank you Kelly. So this let's move on to the 31st. If we we can discuss this in detail when we have SME exactly to make sense of what this data is and how we can use it. But let's we're now target on the 3031.So this is this is the reference data for ICD and CPT code and we we are checking so.We have a product test version of like we we maintain this is more of an industry standard ICD tenant, ICD codes, CPD, CPD codes, right. We have a product test version of it. At least we're gonna check with the product whether it's been.List to the current product version or not. So there was a feature in works that we can directly go to the actual industry standard source from CMS to pull the C industry standard C reference list both for ICD and CPD.Code and we update on our regular cadence based on the whenever it's updated and we maintain that. If that is the case, I don't think we need that information sent over from BCI unless if a BCI has any specific custom CPT codes that you guys should.Internally.If anyone can speak to that what this representative set is for.Kelly Good Clark   51:42Uh.+12*******42   51:45Well.So there are vision procedure codes that are different. Are you guys planning on doing vision claims? Is that on your road map or not?Kelly Good Clark   51:49I'm gonna fill in. I'm gonna put something in the chat.Sathish Dhanasekar   51:59Uh, come again. Uh, done.+12*******42   52:01Are you guys plan is our vision claims on your road map for the interop stuff?Sathish Dhanasekar   52:08Yes, it's not, not, not this year, next year, yes.+12*******42   52:11So vision claims have sort of custom CPT codes. They're procedure codes anyway. They're not CPT codes, but if you want to.Sathish Dhanasekar   52:23Yeah, there's a procedure code to them.+12*******42   52:24If you want to report on them, then that's that information has to be scraped out of the DSP claims. But other than that, the the CPT and I picks and Rug 3 and those kind of codes.Sathish Dhanasekar   52:30So will be.+12*******42   52:40Um.We just need to. We would just want the reference data, the descriptive and the hierarchical components of those.Like like CPTS have categories and so on right that they belong to and we use those in our analytics to roll things up. We we have a data provider for those type of reference that that type of reference information.Called balance, but as far as I know it's just industry standard descriptive information.So the data you get from CMS, what does it have other than the description?Sathish Dhanasekar   53:19Well, it'll be key value per description. I again, I haven't looked at it yet. We are going to check with product like what data we're interesting. This is render set or we're just wanting interesting specific key fields and values.+12*******42   53:25OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   53:38But my question to BCI more of was, is it that the the ICD codes and CPD codes is more of an industry standard or not? If it's basically industry standard, we then we can go book to product if that feature is already slated for police that they can maintain from the.+12*******42   53:47Yeah.Yep.Sathish Dhanasekar   53:56Public source rather than that maintain, but so, but we do need, yeah.+12*******42   54:02Yeah, we can do it. We can do a comparison. Once we see the file layout, we can do a comparison to what we're already getting and I imagine it will line up and then we can just.Go with your process.Sathish Dhanasekar   54:16Yeah, but we still need that procedure code translation to the CPT code for the custom ones, right? For vision claims.+12*******42   54:17So it's a.For vision, yeah, you'll have to scrape the vision claims. It's not a mapping, it's just different codes. You don't have to put them in the same.Sathish Dhanasekar   54:26Yeah.+12*******42   54:33Table as the CPT or ICD or.Pick picks or rug codes. Um.They're just a they're just a different set of procedure codes that we get from our vision claim vendor.Sathish Dhanasekar   54:50So is it a specific? Do they use a custom procedure codes in the platform or those procedure codes also standardized?+12*******42   54:59I don't know. I think they're custom, but.I know they're different from the other code sets. They're not CPT codes. They don't line up with those.So what we typically do for Analytics is we scrape the claim, which does have a description of their procedure code, and then add them to our procedure code cable for Analytics.Sathish Dhanasekar   55:30Mhm.OK.+12*******42   55:37With some vision category codes.Just so people can roll up claims that way, but other than that I don't think they do a detailed analysis of the divisions.I appreciate your codes.Sure.Sathish Dhanasekar   57:02So in that case, I'm going to do one thing.I'm going to come through as a new source.Nilesh Trivedi   57:16So this custom procedure codes does not have any linkage with the standard CPT codes right now within the system. Just want to check on this.Means how it it get refers when they have been checking with the claim submission, yeah.Sagar Shah   57:40Pritesh, these are these are standard codes. It's just that Vision claims, right? They have these V codes. OK, so these are standard only, but it's just V codes which they use separately, not enough. So they should be a part of the standard only.Nilesh Trivedi   57:46Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   57:46Yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   57:51OK, OK, got it.Standard OK.Sagar Shah   57:56Well, it can be a big codes.Sathish Dhanasekar   57:57Oh.But these are procedure codes different than the CPT code. I get it. But then if for their particular system they use some nonstandard procedure code, right?Typically what I've seen is they would have internal translation from non-standardized procedure code to the industry standard procedure code if that if if we not sure that particular their vision source uses.This different versions of custom code, then we would probably need to ingest that code from the BCI list.Sagar Shah   58:39OK.+12*******42   58:41Yeah, and we can do a deeper dive on that. It's been a long time since I worked with Vision claims and we don't have a lot of analytical use cases for Vision claims, so I haven't had a reason to look too closely yet. So we can definitely find you who don't know about it and ask some questions.Sathish Dhanasekar   58:48OK.Yeah, so.OK, yeah, so to this particular question, this vision claims procedure code.****.Yeah, so we need.Yeah, we just need whether that particular vision claims that we're getting is going to have a procedure code, custom procedure code or not. And if not, then we could probably use from the public source if we can. Well, I don't know whether.Product has that. So either way I think we have to ingest this from the BCI Dan. So we would probably need to ingest it as a reference data set from BCI and.Any details would make sense. Uh, probably a little bit more context would be helpful.+12*******42   1:00:15Yeah, I can. I can it. It's actually part of the claims experience file that we get from from our vision claim partner. The the descriptions are in there. We we just all we do is scrape the claims record.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:26Oh, it's a March. Who's the partner?+12*******42   1:00:32All we do is scrape the claims record to get the unique codes and descriptions out of there. So it's all in the vision claim files.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:32OK.So.+12*******42   1:00:41Files.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:43So who's the partner for this patient claim?+12*******42   1:00:47The VSP is the.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:50OK.+12*******42   1:00:50Vision provided.And they're pretty wide. I've never thought to ask them if they have a translation table. Like I said, we don't get a ton of analytical use cases for vision claims, but they may have a translation table. They're big enough that they might have that. Or maybe it's possible that in the years since I looked.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:01:09That'll be that'll be in space.+12*******42   1:01:14Looked at it last. They've switched to standard CPT codes, maybe. I don't know. So we should we should dig a little deeper on that.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:01:32OK. Thank you.Nice. So these are the new ingestions. So we take proclaims chart to win this today.Yes, we do interest today.So retro chart review data supplemental claim. Again, treat me as a new guy. I want to get a context on this retro chart on this claim. I know we are ingesting that today is we have a right people to give a little bit more context on this data set, Dan.This meeting.Vector chart. I'm assuming based on the name, it's kind of a chart data.Of the observation, but I I don't wanna make an assumption. It's it does say supplemental claims so.Kelly Good Clark   1:02:37This might be like our Varadine and our Athena Hell. Dom, is that what you think this is?Or did was that someplace else?Dominic Desimini   1:02:50Uh.Those are CCDS and ADTS.Kelly Good Clark   1:02:56OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah, soSathish Dhanasekar   1:02:58It's oh, OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:03:03So yeah, we we do get those. Um.Yeah, I I guess we just have to figure out how to get them replicated to you.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:03:15So is this a clinical data, CCD and data that we're talking about? OK.Dominic Desimini   1:03:21Yep. Yeah. Clinical was a clinical claims data, I think.Anyway, it's yeah, CCD and then 80.Kelly Good Clark   1:03:29We get it from the VCDSA. Go ahead, sorry.Dominic Desimini   1:03:35Oh, I was just gonna say ADTS are ADTS are the admit discharge documents, admit discharge transfer, I think.I I just made that up, so that may not be right.Kelly Good Clark   1:03:53It's right. Admit discharge transfer is what I've always said. I'm not saying it's right, but it's what I've always said.And ADT is just one of them. So there's the ADT, and then there's this, yeah, okay, you've got the CDCCD.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:04:25It's it's. It's basically admit and discharge records, right?Dominic Desimini   1:04:28Yeah, it's all the hospital stuff.Nilesh Trivedi   1:04:32It's admit discharge class.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:04:37Admit discharge and.Nilesh Trivedi   1:04:40Password.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:04:42Transfer OK.OK, So what data model this fits in?I wanna is can we confirm the?Do we have enough information like to say?What the format and data would be for this we would be assuming in Kelly?But we want we want to take a look at that, confirm this later.Kelly Good Clark   1:05:59Yeah, I'll have to put something together. They're all like fire or Hl. 7 sort of stuff. And yeah, and I I I can look it up, and I can kind of tear apart what we kind of currently have. Sorry, go ahead.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:04Yeah, I figured.Yeah, it's usually the CCD.Yeah, CCD is HL7V. It's HL7 V2 I believe, but I just wanna get that.Nilesh Trivedi   1:06:19So CCDA it is older format. So if CCD is following that will be an XML older format CCDS.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:24Maybe one minute. Yeah, I I think I filled this out. Give me one second.Kelly Good Clark   1:06:30Yeah, it is XML. Yeah, the the the CCD.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:31Oh.Yeah, give me one minute.Thanks CCD.Just for.I can go and add this if the same as if you're following the standard format then it should be the same. There is 2 issues of HL7.Dominic Desimini   1:07:02It's a V2.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:07:05Yeah, but I I don't know if both of them follows the week two or.Oh.Dominic Desimini   1:07:11Uh.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:07:15Yeah, I I we have done the CCD and LDT before, so we we could if it's the standard one, then I think we could we we probably can go and fill this up.It's.Do.Sorry, this one of my notes.This is a new edition.Now cool. Let's go to the.Kelly Good Clark   1:08:14So before that, line 38, the Veradigm clinical data, you might want to maybe tuck it under the retro chart review since it's also clinical data kind of like the CCD stuff.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:08:15So.Mm-hmm.OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:08:31I I don't know. They kind of are that they're kind of together, not necessarily completely. But it's still kind of clinically. Yeah, I would put it right under that one. Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:08:39So this is.OK, then in that case I'll move this.Kelly Good Clark   1:08:56Oh, yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   1:09:12So Satish, for the supplemental or clinical data, what are the other sources? Because it mentioned supplemental, but where except where and what are the other sources as well for the clinical data? It's a EMR. Is there any EMR data also that I've been getting?Kelly Good Clark   1:09:30That sounds familiar to EMR.Nilesh Trivedi   1:09:38Maybe we can have that question hard.Dominic Desimini   1:09:44We get some data through the clinical data hub.Whatever they call that thing at the association. Um, we also have a couple other sources. Um.Cannot think of the name of those.Kelly Good Clark   1:10:06Are you thinking of like LabCorp and quest diagnostic that are clinical? Okay.Dominic Desimini   1:10:11Well, no, I was thinking like bamboo, but we don't do bamboo anymore. But we have a couple other of those clinical datas that with that HCO is using.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:10:12So we have lab core.Yeah, I'm just putting it as a new entry, Dominic, but if you are getting any specific EMO clinical data, that's it's fine if it's from the different source as long as if it's in the same HL7.And uh, the format I'm assuming it's gonna be the same direction on V2 or but um.Dominic Desimini   1:10:52I I don't actually know that it is.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:10:56OK.Dominic Desimini   1:10:57That's just I don't know that our what what format that data is coming in and and I don't even know where it's landing to be honest.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:11:09So IS - IT the different source than the veradigm, Dominic?Dominic Desimini   1:11:15Yeah, it's not from the association, it's, but I can't think of the name of it.Kelly Good Clark   1:11:23Yeah, so yeah, we just realized Tamara Hess's team does the EMR data because Dave Johnson does that because they they pull it in right now into HDS. But that's all I really know about it. I don't know if Dan knows any more about it.If not, we can, when Tamara is here tomorrow, I'll let her know that's one of the things we need to talk about as well.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:11:44Yeah, we.So here's the thing Kelly, like unless we have A - specific immediate EDP use case today, 2025, right? We really don't. We have time, but - IT will become mandatory for 0057 if we that IS we're gonna pick up next year.So we can easily table that for more detailed conversation next year or if you prefer, we can also discuss - IT in this implementation as well. It's but we won't.We won't have A - need for - IT until next, probably next year, at least from A - mad perspective.Kelly Good Clark   1:12:28OK. OK. And I I just wanted to put like a business here on that owner on that too and that would have been Tamara has, but yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:12:35OK.OK, Salesforce.So the the.From the description I'm getting, it's it's more of a benefit group. Is it like an employee group code or kind of an asset like who is it? Do we have any SME to provide a little bit more context on this source? What type of data is it?+12*******42   1:14:07OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:14:13So I.Kelly Good Clark   1:14:15Yeah. So okay. So and I could be wrong. If we're If we're looking at, so we do have these slated to be replicated to you from. So - IT says Salesforce. However, Dan, I'm going to put these in the the chat, the tables in the chat.That are and that's the gemstone, so and there's like A - few as well. But I believe that this IS what they're looking for. I don't think as far as I know, I don't think they're looking to. I mean, we can go directly to Salesforce. I don't know how what the plan IS on that.But Dan, I think these are what we need if that's for line 35 and right now we actually have those on the list to advocate for for the the new list to be replicated and it's coming from DCI extension.+12*******42   1:15:04OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:15:08From gemstone version but.+12*******42   1:15:11Yeah, um.Kelly Good Clark   1:15:13Whether or not we should be doing directly from Salesforce, I don't know.+12*******42   1:15:18I don't know what the scope for Salesforce is. My, I mean, my reflex would be, yeah, we should be pulling directly from Salesforce, but I know we've had issues getting connected to Salesforce for that purpose. Um, we can talk to Amith, uh.On James Mills team and see, I think he wrote the extracts from Salesforce. Now we can see what how much transformation they go to because I don't think they're raw Salesforce data. I think they're like data extracted from Salesforce somehow.Um, but put into a single file instead of multiple things, yeah.Kelly Good Clark   1:15:54I think they're transform stuff.+12*******42   1:16:01So if we have them replicated, that covers us for now, but we probably want to look into whether there's other data in Salesforce that we need to bring in and whether that would be worth going to Salesforce directly for.Because I think there's some on Prem processes that we probably want to phase out if we can behind those tables.Hello.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:16:25So it's activity like.+12*******42   1:16:28Yeah. So for now we're covered with those four files, but there might be new requirements coming that I'm not aware of, so.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:16:37So yeah, so we so is it the author?+12*******42   1:16:38We may, so we should talk to.So I would want to talk with Lindsay about future use of the Salesforce data, what the roadmap includes. I don't know if she's had those conversations with our sales and marketing folks, how they're going to want to leverage this, the information they have in Salesforce.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:16:44Quiet salt.+12*******42   1:17:03umm So Lindsay might be more aware of that. She's the PDP program manager, so she might have some visibility of that that I don't have.But in terms of our hard needs, like the stuff that we need right now to do our work, those four are covered, I think.Lorraine Maldonado   1:17:25And and I'm sorry if I missed it. I'm sorry if I missed it. Are you saying that those four are already being replicated?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:17:25Yeah, do.+12*******42   1:17:33That's what Kelly said. Is that is that true, Kelly? That's kind of how I.Lorraine Maldonado   1:17:36OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:17:37They they are on the list to be. I don't think you guys are getting them right now, but they but yeah, they're on the list. I mean, you might be getting them. I'd have to go look, but they are definitely on the list going forward, I suspect. Yeah, I I would be surprised if you guys are getting the gemstone version of these just because of one thing.+12*******42   1:17:41They're on the list, OK.Lorraine Maldonado   1:17:42Um.Mm-hmm.Kelly Good Clark   1:17:57just kind of stop kind of working on - IT or whatever. But they are on the list to be coming in on the next one that's getting prepared right now with CSV.Lorraine Maldonado   1:18:04Mm.OK. Thank you.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:18:12Right, but what? What are this program mod codes, program groups and program lists? Is it?Is there?+12*******42   1:18:20Oh, these are buy up programs. So these are buy up programs that we offer to groups and some of our individuals plans for things like smoking cessation or diabetes prevention or diabetes management, weight loss, those kind of supplemental programs.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:18:34Oh.This this is outreach programs OK.+12*******42   1:18:38That that groups can buy into, yeah. So if the groups that buy into those programs have have essentially eligibility for those programs for a certain period of time and that can term start start in term just like an eligibility sort of record and that's what this this information is the group.Program eligibility is just the information on what programs the groups have enrolled in.And some individuals have enrolled in that they're eligible for. And then in Jeeva, which is our clinical editing software package, we track their progress in those programs. So we use this data to link.The group buy up information to the individual member milestones that that they go through as part of these programs and their progress in them so that we can measure the success of those programs and report that back to the groups basically.Of how their program's getting utilized.So the detailed information is in Geva. This is kind of the sales side of the information of the products they're selling to the groups.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:19:50Yeah, this is this is sort of a metrics for you guys.+12*******42   1:19:55Yeah, these are internal metrics I'm.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:19:56Oh, this is the poor health improvement concepts, right? So that the better.+12*******42   1:20:00Yeah, Yep. Just program tracking and and evaluation, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:20:02It is.Evaluation contributes to he scores and all this stuff, yeah.+12*******42   1:20:10Yeah, yeah, it would flow downstream to heat us and so on.So in terms of future use cases for the Salesforce data, as we get into our broker and sales domain, then I might have inform more information about that if you if you want to look down the road a ways, but for right now this covers it.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:20:34OK, so for now I think it's for now let's.So it's more like a source only data for other future analytical use cases.+12*******42   1:20:43For those four tables, it would just be like source and data, but there might be an expanded set of use cases that require us to go directly to Salesforce. I just don't know when that would happen. I'm pretty sure that would happen that we would want all the data in Salesforce or all the.Relevant data in Salesforce directly from Salesforce, but I don't know when that would be happening, so that might be outside the scope of this discussion. We'd have to ask Lindsay where that falls in the roadmap.And I could ask her, even if she can't make it to these meetings, I can probably have an answer tomorrow on that on the Salesforce question.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:21:28OK.+12*******42   1:21:36I'm making note of that.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:21:50And I'm assuming this is the same same the addition fee would be the same format as it is like flat file or delimited or is that a stream?+12*******42   1:21:55Thank you.I don't know.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:22:03So based on what Kelly said, it's probably object replication, right? I'm assuming it's a.Flat file delimiter or Jason?+12*******42   1:22:09Yeah, if we went, if we went directly to Salesforce, it would probably be extreme, I would imagine would be our preference. But I I don't know when we when we got the Salesforce data before the first time, the first run we took at it was a little messy and they were in files, is that right?Dominic Desimini   1:22:20Will be.+12*******42   1:22:26OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:22:28Are we still, we're still talking about the the those 4 tables?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:22:36Yeah.Kelly Good Clark   1:22:37Yeah, so yeah, so they're going to be replicated. So those four tables will be replicated by the database tables. And so, yeah, so and it's on a spreadsheet that I sent to you guys in I can send it, but they're in a database right now called BCI.+12*******42   1:22:37Oh, sorry, I was talking about Salesforce.That's my fault.OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:22:57Extension and so they will just be replicated over as those finished tables.Um.as a Csv like like the rest of the the database tables will be replicating, unless, of course, like like Dan was talking about. Do we send you guys the core, you know the source of those? Um, I don't know. I I that would take some digging, I think, to find out. Yeah,+12*******42   1:23:05T.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:23:11OK.+12*******42   1:23:20OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:23:21No.Yeah, we we can consume from the stream. We have, we have a capability to consume from the stream. That's what you guys prefer. We are open to it.+12*******42   1:23:23OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:23:31We are either risk good.So I'll I'll leave it to you Kelly. If you want to do the current process of object replication through flat file, I'm OK. But if you prefer you want to avoid that one hop setting you want directly consume from Steam. Sure we can.But then this would involve.We need to know what's a topic we're gonna consume from and all this information.OK. So Kelly, so it's up to you.Kelly Good Clark   1:24:13Yeah, my my understanding, yeah, like I said, my understanding is those are the four tables we're sending to you, unless someone else says no, they'll find out what all those tables are in Salesforce. And then, like I said, there is some transformation on themalready that Amy does. Umm ButI think unless Dan objects, I think these tables are are proper until we do a full Salesforce. You know when we start doing more Salesforce I I don't know Dan, what you're comfortable with.+12*******42   1:24:51Yeah, I agree. I agree with that thing, Kelly.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:24:57OK, so if you're already translate.+12*******42   1:24:58I'll just, I'll just think that I'll ping Lindsay today and ask her if if the complete ingestion of Salesforce as a source is on the road map somewhere and where she thinks it'll fall just so we know when that when that's coming.And I don't know what the scope of your interop agreement covers. I don't know if it covers Salesforce as a source, but I can ask that.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:23This is this is part of EDP. This we we don't need that for interrupt. We we are considering this is more like coming from your EDP directive.+12*******42   1:25:29OK, yeah, this would be.Yeah, yeah, this would be the support ADP.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:35Yeah.+12*******42   1:25:37So it may just be a. So you're saying it's just a source suggestion that's not a foundation mark or a subject area mark?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:43Right. If if we if we if there is any source that we're any data set that are ingesting from Salesforce, if that contributes to a larger standardized foundational mark, yes we can we can populate that but base it's.Based on what you again, we may have one. I'll have to go and check, but based on what you describe is more of an outreach programs you run through Salesforce, right? So it looks, yeah, it looks more like a source only data for a specific use case like.+12*******42   1:26:11Right here. Yep.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:26:17I know we are right, but I'm just want to confirm do we since you said that for these four tables you already have a translation and transformation applied. So it might probably if we are considering only these forces, it would probably make sense just.+12*******42   1:26:17Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:26:34To the same pattern as flat 5 if you already have a upload transformation. But if you have a larger goal, no I we need holistic information that all the data sets that we run, all the data program programs we run in the Salesforce. Let's go and just all of the data sets from Salesforce.Then it probably makes sense approach from a holistic perspective. OK, let's consume everything from the stream, right? Interrupt building the one off position scenarios and have.+12*******42   1:26:57Yes, that sounds good.Yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't want to fill the one off. Yeah, but we can adjust these four for for now. I'll I'll talk to Lindsay about what our future plans for Salesforce are and see if they're if we need to consider them for part of this work or if we can postpone those till till later.OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:28:01OK, let's see. And you some colleague posted something in the chat. It's for this is former health insurance claim number, which was a former unique identifier for Medicare.Use for processing claims and eligibility of Medicare Access and CHIP Authorization Act mandated the replacement of HCNS with a new randomly generated Medicare beneficiary can be.Security starting January 1st, 2020 and BSP on the primary, although it's still used for some limited administrative purposes and historical data, so.Kelly Good Clark   1:28:45So this ticking question has come out a few times, and it's and one I don't know who's asking for it, because originally I thought it was like from Sean Smith's area. But then they said they didn't know what it was, which I thought was weird. So I I guess.you know, who's asking for the tick-in? And really, like I said, so now we're going to NBI, and and really it's going to be on some of the facets tables. So maybe when it, so yeah, I don't know, maybe you guys need to know where that sort of stuff is actuallylocated. I don't know if we have a true crosswalk. Maybe we do. Maybe Dan knows.+12*******42   1:29:31We could create, we could create a crosswalk if we wanted to. That information is on the member record. I think the field is still referred to as a hicken, even though it's the NBI in that field. And then we have a.A table that shows the change in Hickens slash MBI over time. So we can we can relate old Hickens to members if we need to through that or or and or the MBI to members through that.Cable and that is the MEMD table in gasses.It's like a Medicare event table, so he can um.PPP contract and segment information.Risk information, stuff like that gets stored in that table, and so we can grab the identification numbers out of that if we need to and the dates that they were effective. But like you said, Kelly, I think everybody has switched to using the MBI instead of the Hickin.I don't know that we need the crosswalk. Well, it was it was 2020, so records before that we might need to translate from the heck and.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:30:54Well, think of we gonna.+12*******42   1:30:55If we're going for seven years prior to that conversion.Yeah, yeah. So that happened in 20.20.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:31:05And program, yeah.+12*******42   1:31:07Yeah, the the MBI switch was like five or six years ago, so we probably do need the crosswalk. But I'm pretty. I think all the information we need to build that crosswalk is in the fastest tables. So all the ingredients are there between the member record and the.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:31:14Oh.Kelly Good Clark   1:31:22But who needs it?+12*******42   1:31:23MEMB record. I don't know who needs it.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:31:25Yes, that's that's a question that will need set, right. So to this probably Nilesh like do we really need this?+12*******42   1:31:29Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:31:34From the intra perspective.   1:31:35But.Nilesh Trivedi   1:31:37That is what the question Satish, because we have if we get these from the facets, do we really require that if we have that this HIC and MBI from the facets, that is what the question is.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:31:51OK.Well, say this. OK, so in the facets, do we have a specific column that tracks it's in this number from facet claim table?+12*******42   1:32:04Yeah, we have a couple of different tables that do that. So the first one is the member table, just the MEME member table in facets and that one has the current identifying number for Medicare in it. The field I think still says Hicken on it, but it's the it should be the MBI.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:32:13Mhm.+12*******42   1:32:24yeah So that's the that's the as is identifier. And if that's all we need, then we're good with that member data. The history of how those identifiers have changed is in the MEMD record in facets.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:32:28Mhm.+12*******42   1:32:40It has a specific record type and then date ranges associated with it and and that would have the member key on it as well. So we could take the member key and associate it to whatever identifiers were in use at the time if we wanted to create a crosswalk.for older data prior to the NBI switch.I don't think you need it for the facets information, but if we're trying to marry this stuff to files that we got from CMS 10 years ago, then we might need it.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:33:15But the the the unless the question is do we need this?Crosswalk from intra perspective in a data element.Nilesh Trivedi   1:33:25In interrupt perspective we we we do not require that, but maybe from the ADB perspective I'm not sure because looks like for historical data I believe facet legacy might have the previous data right of post 2016.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:33:25So.+12*******42   1:33:26Good question.OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:33:40Right, so so.Nilesh Trivedi   1:33:42So in that case it will help.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:33:45Um.+12*******42   1:33:47Yeah, yeah. The older data would be in facets, the same tables. But yeah, I'm not, I'm not too worried about the EDP requirements. We have the ingredients we need for the EDP from the facets core tables for the Hickin.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:33:52Legacy.+12*******42   1:34:04Slash NBI.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:34:05So the the question is Dan then do we need to just start in UDP and VDP enrollment this crosswalk. So I'm assuming this XN member crosswalk is it it's basically gives you the crosswalk between the member to XN.ID and then to the MBI.So the question is.+12*******42   1:34:24Good question. I don't know what this crosswalk is besides the information that's in facets. That's what I've always used. So this is not really a crosswalk.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:34:42So.+12*******42   1:34:45So I'm not even sure that who to ask. Maybe, maybe that's a Tamara question. If there's something going on with that crosswalk that needs to support their processes.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:34:55Yeah, because somebody mentioned this, we need to import this data, right?+12*******42   1:34:56So yeah, so if we if we have Tamara on the meeting tomorrow, we should ask her about this and about those other government programs questions that we have.Kelly Good Clark   1:34:57Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah. Because this is CMS.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:35:05OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:35:07Yeah, because this is a CMS. Yeah, this is CMS.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:35:07Let's put the meeting.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:35:13I think this crosswalk I'm just recollecting from the previous be risk adjustment SOW right? So we found that certain members can have multiple AK or MBI. I I don't remember exactly.+12*******42   1:35:32Yeah, yeah, they can have multiple over time.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:35:33But the Hickin and FBI were not.+12*******42   1:35:37Hickens can change in cases of fraud and so on in the past. So they had they can't move from 1 Hicken to another and then everybody moves from Hicken to MBI several years ago. So there would definitely be a crosswalk there and there could be a Hicken to Hicken crosswalk prior to that.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:35:41Yeah.Correct.MBI, right?+12*******42   1:35:54The good things are supposed to be permanent, but when they're fraud or something, then they can change them just like NBIS.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:35:55Yeah, I think this refers to that specific.Mhm.OK, maybe this cross work is aiming to resolve that issue when we have multiple hickens.+12*******42   1:36:09OK.Yeah, could be. You can always get the current hicken or current identifier out of the member table, but maybe there's a need for translating historical data.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:36:12Right.E.That that's that's a question Dan. So if if you're the the current Akin member, it can for our members already there the facets table, do we have any use case that we need to get to the older Akin for the member?Or maybe.+12*******42   1:36:40If we do, we should be able to do that based on the facets data. So if there's a use case where we can't get to that, then maybe we should ask Tamara if there's some other use case, but that MEMD, that set of MEMD tables from gemstone and legacy facets in theory.should give us the history of all the identifiers a member has had over time.And that would be tied to the member keys and facets, which don't change when they change those identifying numbers. So if they got a hit and change, they would retain the same member key.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:37:12Are you?Are you when you say the member key, are you talking about the Yumi?+12*******42   1:37:21The CK, the Mimi CK in facets.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:37:23Mimi CK. I think we found that in these scenarios the Mimi CK was also changing. So multiple Hicken, multiple Mimi CK, but probably the same UV.+12*******42   1:37:38Really. OK.Yeah, they would have the same Umi because they're the same person, but that doesn't help us identify the member. The Umi doesn't help us identify the member, it helps us identify the person.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:37:46Mm-hmm.OK.+12*******42   1:37:52So we do need to get back to the member and if the CK's are changing, then yeah, we may need to connect history, although I thought the CK's did not change, so we should confirm that but.Yeah.But we could use the the Omi to tie those histories together. Maybe. Um.In order to create the crosswalk if the new UCK is changing over time as well.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:38:36Right. I think we do anything.+12*******42   1:38:37It it gets a little back here because they can have commercial policies as well. The same person can have both commercial and Medicare. So you have to be careful to only look at their Medicare stuff.Vallimala Palaneeappan   1:38:41Hmm.Yep.Mm.+12*******42   1:38:53But once we go up to the uni level, then we're at the person level and then they can have all kinds of different policies and so on.At the at the member key level, we know what population they're part of, you know what I mean?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:39:16OK, I'm putting this as TBD for now to.+12*******42   1:39:20Yeah, OK, Tamara.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:39:21So you have to confirm whether we do need this crosswalk or not. OK.Oh yes, this is the question before I had it.So is it the separate provided directory data outside of assets that we're getting from?+12*******42   1:39:56So.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:40:07So BPDBCBSC provider directory who can shed some light on the source like is it a provider directory specifically an external provider directory that we are getting from other health plans that we need to?Post as well or is it?Kelly Good Clark   1:40:25So it comes it comes from BC BSA. So So BC BSA is the whatever owner of the data, per se, and they and we get it from them. And it's inSathish Dhanasekar   1:40:26So.Kelly Good Clark   1:40:40HL7 format.+12*******42   1:40:48And it contains information about other Blues plans providers, is that right, Kelly? It's across all the plans, the BPD, or is it just our data?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:40:48What's the problem?Kelly Good Clark   1:40:57Yeah, yeah.I believe it's across all of the plants.+12*******42   1:41:07Cool.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:41:15So the question is then should it be part of the so Nilesh, it's a provider directly from outside of BCH network from other blue plants. So if as a member if I'm going to.Kelly Good Clark   1:41:29Rich.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:41:30Yeah, go ahead.Kelly Good Clark   1:41:31Yeah, Rich Tallon and Suresh are normally on the line, and they would be the best, but neither one happens to be on this. I don't know if they got invited, and just too busy. UmmNilesh Trivedi   1:41:43So you can add the question, do we really have to consider it to the rich right? Rich will be the best person I think what if I heard. So we need to ask do we have to consider it for the BCI or not this provider directory?Kelly Good Clark   1:41:44But yeah, that they would normally.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:41:55Famous product product directly.Nilesh Trivedi   1:41:59Yes. And my next question is do we does BCI publish this provider directory to their members or not?+12*******42   1:42:13That I don't know either. So that's probably a good talent, rich talent question.Dominic Desimini   1:42:18We publish it through the fire APIs for sure.+12*******42   1:42:20But.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:42:22Oh, then it's needed then.Nilesh Trivedi   1:42:25Yeah. So, yeah, but it is. But if it is offer other plans, in that case that is the question that do we really require because we have the providers above facets within the facets. So in that case need to be checked.+12*******42   1:42:368.Well, these providers would be on claims and facets.Nilesh Trivedi   1:42:45Right, so.+12*******42   1:42:46Because we have claims in facets for other for non contracting providers from other plans, right? So we have host, host claims.Nilesh Trivedi   1:42:53Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:42:53But it will not be. But these providers won't be in your provider network. It's outside of the BCS provider network from the other blue plants.+12*******42   1:42:58Correct. Yeah, it won't be in our unit directly in the provider data in facets. It would be on the claim record. There's a there's a record in facets of the claim as it came in that has this information on it, but it's really kind of messy.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:43:16OK, so here's the thing. So if so if if I'm a member, it's outside the state. If I'm looking for a provider to for a service and come to BCI and we would be. So we are posting this information as part of a BCI's provider net provided directly somebody to look up, right?+12*******42   1:43:17So.Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:43:35Right. And if we are also posting this as part of fire today, are we?+12*******42   1:43:37Yeah.Is that true, Dom? I don't think we'd give our members the our any information on other blues plan providers networks. So I think they have to go to that page and look it up. Is that true?Dominic Desimini   1:43:55Yes, I don't believe we we maintain the entire provider directory for the nation.+12*******42   1:43:55If you change that.Yeah, yeah. That doesn't seem like something we would do. So when the member goes to the member portal to look up a provider, it's just our contracting providers and they have to click out to the other Blue's plans to to look up a provider for that network.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:44:05OK.Kelly Good Clark   1:44:08I know.+12*******42   1:44:20If they're out of state, if they're and we have lots of members obviously that that live out of state permanently and go to another plans provider and we get their claims through the ITS system.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:44:20OK.+12*******42   1:44:36Between the plans.Kelly Good Clark   1:44:39I know that, I know that one of the use cases that are really needed is provider termination. Apparently this is almost the only place to get it anymore. So So even for the 110th, we don't take, we we are not very good in thousanddata was the provider termination. And I I think that's one of the biggest use cases of this data. I mean, there's a lot there. I mean to say that's the biggest use case, but I I know it's a highly needed use case.And I know that's what Rich Tallon has used it for. I know Rob Hopper needs it. So, but the provider termination, because it comes in different, there's different things. There's termination, there's demographics.quality, and there's something else, but that terminations one I know is is pretty important.But again, I think with Rich without, I think Rich Tallon would be a good, he's worked on this data for like 2 years.So.Dominic Desimini   1:45:56Dale, can we make sure that Rich is invited to all these meetings?If if Dale's here, did Dale leave?Lorraine Maldonado   1:46:08He he is on the invites. Actually, I was just looking at it, but he is on and I'll be sending an update, but yeah.Dominic Desimini   1:46:11OK.Thanks.Lorraine Maldonado   1:46:19I'll talk to Dale later. I'll I'll ask Dale if you can maybe reach out.To rich.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:46:26So should we should should we wait for Rich or Suresh from the next meeting to go detail like?Dominic Desimini   1:46:31They're gonna know PDT. Yeah, they're gonna know PDT data, so you're gonna wanna wait for them to get on the phone.Lorraine Maldonado   1:47:03So we are pretty much at time. Just have a few more minutes. Uh, couple more. Um.Satish, I don't know if you want to wrap up here.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:47:10Yeah, it's it's about, yes, we have.Three more minutes, I think.We can probably stop here, Lauren. Then we have only three more lists. I think we can get to it tomorrow and then after that Nilesh has some questions we can go on.Lorraine Maldonado   1:47:37OK, I'll I will mhm.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:47:37And the file. So Lauren, before we sign off, what? So these are the lists we have. If we think we will definitely post this and compile it this week and then the next set of like is there any other sources that we have not considered?Lorraine Maldonado   1:47:41Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:47:53Either as part of the EDPR 95, then we can and we can consider it on 2026, but yeah, I think that's that's fine.I I think we'll stop here. I'll stop here, Lauren, and then we'll discuss the three the next session and then after that Dilish has some questions.Lorraine Maldonado   1:48:03OK.OK.Dale Fryer   1:48:12And and Lorraine, I'll work with you. I know there was some key people that we need to follow up with. I'll, I'll make sure I'm pushing that to make sure there's attendance in tomorrow's session for the key people that we didn't have today.Lorraine Maldonado   1:48:12OK.OK, sure. Yeah. And there are maybe at some point, and I don't know, Satish, there were some open items, action items that we had captured from previous discovery sessions. I don't know if we'll touch on that tomorrow or not. I did share that list with you, Dale. I wasn't sure if I should send it out directly or if it should go through you first. So I didn't, I didn't take.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:48:38Yes.Dale Fryer   1:48:44Yeah.Lorraine Maldonado   1:48:47Any liberties until we until we chat, but we'll chat later today and we can decide how you want to handle that going forward.Dale Fryer   1:48:56OK, sounds good.Lorraine Maldonado   1:48:58OK, no problem. Then I'm gonna clean up that invite, which went out for daily for the next year instead of today and tomorrow. So I'm gonna take my time, make sure I don't make any mistakes on the on the resend here. I will. I see Rich is included and then Suresh Kumar.Vuppu. I'm not sure what his exact e-mail is, so maybe Dale, if you want to ping that and maybe I'll make sure I get him in this update for tomorrow's session.if you like.Dale Fryer   1:49:30Sure. OK, will do.Lorraine Maldonado   1:49:33OK, or I'll send out whatever and you can forward it to to Suresh.All right. Thank you, everyone. Um We will meet up again tomorrow. Thank you.Dominic Desimini   1:49:47Thank you.Lorraine Maldonado   1:49:48Alrighty, ciao.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:49:50You're on. Thank you for that.Dominic Desimini   1:49:50So.Lorraine Maldonado stopped transcription
