    title: "The 'Team of Interns' Metaphor"
    text_elements:
      - type: main_title
        content: "Your 'Team of Interns'"
      - type: labels
        content: ["Fast", "Cheap", "Eager to Please", "Lacks Experience"]
    visual_direction: |
      Central illustration of 3-4 friendly, eager intern characters (simple, approachable style).
      Characters should look bright and helpful but slightly naive or uncertain.
      Surround them with floating labels or badges showing their traits.
      Include subtle visual cues: speed lines for "fast", dollar signs crossed out for "cheap",
      question marks floating nearby for "lacks experience".
    notes: "This metaphor is the throughline of the entire presentation"

    title: "From Intuition to Engineering"
    text_elements:
      - type: main_title
        content: "From Intuition to Engineering"
      - type: comparison_left
        content: "Casual Chat"
      - type: comparison_right
        content: "Technical Discipline"
    visual_direction: |
      Split composition showing transformation/evolution.
      Left side: casual, informal representation (speech bubbles, question marks, loose/sketchy).
      Right side: structured, engineered representation (blueprints, diagrams, precision tools).
      Arrow or visual flow connecting left to right showing the progression.
    notes: "Emphasizes the shift in mindset the presentation advocates"

    title: "The Agenda / The Toolkit"
    text_elements:
      - type: main_title
        content: "The Toolkit"
      - type: numbered_list
        content:
          - "1. Self-Correction Systems"
          - "2. Meta-Prompting"
          - "3. Reasoning Scaffolds"
          - "4. Perspective Engineering"
          - "5. Specialized Tactics"
      - type: footer
        content: "Resources: [Confluence Link]"
    visual_direction: |
      Visual representation of a toolkit or toolbox concept.
      Five distinct tools or compartments, each representing one tier.
      Tools should be visually distinct and hint at their function:
      - Self-Correction: loop/cycle symbol
      - Meta-Prompting: nested boxes or recursion hint
      - Reasoning Scaffolds: ladder or framework structure
      - Perspective Engineering: multiple viewpoints/faces
      - Specialized Tactics: precision instruments
    notes: "Consider showing the 5 tiers as a visual hierarchy or progression"
