### UC03: AI-Assisted Data Vault Code Generation (Greenfield)

**Status**: Requirements defined, not implemented

#### Portfolio Readiness: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Low (But High Potential)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ **Ambitious concept**: Generate complete Data Vault code from design specs
- ✅ **Novel approach**: YAML/Mermaid → dbt code generation
- ✅ **High technical complexity**: Multi-step AI workflow
- ✅ **Clear business value**: 60-80% reduction in coding time (projected)
- ✅ **Well-documented requirements**: Comprehensive spec already written

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ **Not implemented yet** - no working example
- ❌ **No metrics** - all projections, no proven results
- ❌ **Significant development effort** needed (8-12+ weeks)
- ❌ **Higher risk** - may not achieve projected savings

**Portfolio Potential** (if implemented):
- **Project Title**: "AI Code Generator for Data Vault 2.0: Design to Deployment in Minutes"
- **Story**: Built AI-powered code generation system that translates entity design specifications (YAML or Mermaid diagrams) into complete, production-ready dbt models following Data Vault 2.0 patterns. Reduces initial coding time by 60-80%, ensures pattern consistency across 100+ entities.
- **Projected Metrics**:
  - 60-80% time savings vs. manual coding
  - 95%+ consistency with standards
  - 85%+ code compiles without manual changes
- **Artifacts** (if built):
  - Architecture diagram of generation pipeline
  - Example inputs (YAML, Mermaid)
  - Generated code examples
  - Validation and testing approach
  - GitHub repo with generator tool
  - Comprehensive documentation

**Why This is Lower Priority**:
1. **Not proven yet** - portfolio needs real results, not concepts
2. **Significant investment** - 8-12+ weeks to build vs. 4-6 weeks to polish UC02
3. **Higher risk** - may not achieve projected benefits
4. **Less immediately useful** - UC01 and UC02 solve current pain points

**Recommendation**:
- **Defer to Q2-Q3 2026** after UC02 is portfolio-ready
- Use as "future work" or "vision" in presentations about UC01/UC02
- Consider building prototype during master's program (could be thesis project?)

**Action Items** (if pursuing):
- [ ] Build prototype with 1-2 simple entities
- [ ] Prove concept with measurable time savings
- [ ] Refine based on learnings
- [ ] Then evaluate for portfolio inclusion

**Timeline**: 8-12+ weeks development → Portfolio-ready by Q2-Q3 2026 at earliest

## Recommendation

### For Your Career Plan Q1 2026 POC

**Original Plan**: Contract Benefits POC (PDF summarization)
**Consideration**: Could UC02 BE your Q1 2026 POC?

**Option A: Focus on UC02 as Q1 2026 Portfolio Project**
- Complete 2-3 more EDW dimensions using AI-assisted migration
- Document time savings and business impact rigorously
- Polish for portfolio by end of Q1 2026
- This becomes **Portfolio Project #1** for career plan

**Option B: Do Both**
- UC02: Polish existing work (class_type) for portfolio (December 2025)
- Contract Benefits POC: Execute in Q1 2026 as planned
- Result: Two portfolio projects by Q1 2026 end

**Option C: Pivot to UC02**
- Make UC02 your primary focus for Q4 2025 - Q1 2026
- Complete 3-4 dimensions with metrics
- Defer Contract Benefits POC to Q2 2026
- Result: One strong, comprehensive portfolio project

**My Recommendation**: **Option A**
- UC02 is already well-developed
- Completing 2-3 more entities proves replicability
- You control the timeline (not dependent on stakeholder availability)
- Less risk than starting new POC (Contract Benefits)
- Could still do Contract Benefits in Q2 if bandwidth allows
