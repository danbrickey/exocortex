## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Not Enough Time in Oct-Dec
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize 3 dimensions (not 5) if bandwidth is tight
- Focus on quality over quantity
- January polish phase can absorb some work
**Contingency**: Extend operational phase into January first week

### Risk 2: Document AI POC Takes All Q1 Time
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- UC02 portfolio polish is mostly documentation (not new implementation)
- Can do in evenings/weekends if needed (10-12 hours/week personal time)
- Most artifacts can be created in January before POC ramps up
**Contingency**: Defer LinkedIn/conference submission to February, focus on core artifacts (slide deck, briefing doc)

### Risk 3: Workflow Doesn't Work as Well for Other Dimensions
**Likelihood**: Low-Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Document variations and edge cases as you encounter them
- Refine workflow based on learnings
- Show adaptability in portfolio (not just cookie-cutter approach)
**Contingency**: Focus portfolio on successful dimensions, note limitations honestly

### Risk 4: Can't Share Due to Confidentiality
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Anonymize dimension names, company names, business rules
- Focus on architecture and AI workflow, not specific business logic
- Get approval from leadership if needed
**Contingency**: Create completely anonymized example using generic healthcare domain
