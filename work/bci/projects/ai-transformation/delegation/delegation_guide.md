# Delegation Guide

## Why This Exists
Delegation anxiety is real. Having scripts and frameworks reduces the cognitive load and makes it easier to delegate consistently.

---

## The Delegation Framework

### 1. Identify the Task
- **Task**: Clear description
- **Current time spent**: X hours/week or month
- **Why delegate**: Frees up architecture time, develops team member, etc.
- **Best person**: Who has capacity and would benefit from growth

### 2. Prepare Context
Before the conversation, prepare:
- **What**: Clear task description
- **Why**: Why this matters, business context
- **How**: Process, resources, examples
- **Success criteria**: What "done" looks like
- **Support available**: How you'll help

### 3. Have the Conversation
Use the scripts below for common scenarios.

### 4. Follow Up
- Set follow-up date (1 week for new delegate, 2 weeks for experienced)
- Check in lightly (don't hover)
- Course-correct if needed

### 5. Reflect
- Track your anxiety/fear vs. actual outcome
- Document the pattern
- Build evidence that delegation works

## Delegation Scripts

### Script 1: Delegating Technical Task
```
"Hey [Name], I have a task that I think would be a good growth opportunity for you.

We need to [task description]. This is important because [business context].

Here's what success looks like: [clear criteria]

I think this is a good fit for you because [specific reason - their skills, growth area, etc.].

I'll be available for questions, and let's check in on [date] to see how it's going. Does that work for you?"
```

**When to use**: New technical task, mentee ready for stretch assignment

---

### Script 2: Delegating Code/Design Review
```
"Hey [Name], I'd like to start having you handle [type of reviews] going forward.

Here's my thinking: You've been doing great work on [their area], and this will help you see patterns across the codebase and develop your architectural thinking.

I've created a review checklist here: [link]. Let's do the first 2-3 together so you can see my process, then you can start owning these.

Sound good?"
```

**When to use**: Building capability, you're doing too many reviews

---

### Script 3: Delegating Something You've Always Done
```
"Hey [Name], I want to transition [task] to you.

Context: I've been doing this because [historical reason], but it makes more sense for you to own it because [logical reason - closer to the work, your area, etc.].

I'll do a full walkthrough, document the process, and be available for the first few cycles. Let's set up time to go through it together."
```

**When to use**: Your old responsibilities that logically belong elsewhere

---

### Script 4: When You're Nervous About Delegating
*(This is the script for YOU, not for them)*

**Before the conversation, remind yourself**:
1. "What's the evidence that this will go badly?" (Usually: none)
2. "What's the worst realistic outcome?" (They ask questions, need help - that's normal)
3. "What's the best realistic outcome?" (They succeed, I free up time, they grow)
4. "What have past delegations taught me?" (People usually rise to the occasion)

**Then use one of the scripts above.**

---

### Script 5: Following Up on Delegated Task
```
"Hey [Name], just checking in on [task]. How's it going?

[Listen to their response]

[If stuck]: "What's blocking you? How can I help?"
[If going well]: "Great! Let me know if you hit any issues."
[If they need direction]: "Here's how I'd approach that: [guidance]"
```

**When to use**: Follow-up meetings, Slack check-ins

## Common Fears & Counter-Evidence

| Fear | Counter-Evidence (Track Your Own!) |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| "They'll think I'm lazy" | Outcomes: Carl was fine, Shawn was fine, Martin appreciates the growth opportunity |
| "They'll be annoyed" | Outcomes: No one has been annoyed. Response time is normal. Tone is professional. |
| "It will be done wrong" | Reality: Most tasks are done fine. When issues arise, they're learning opportunities. |
| "I should just do it myself" | Reality: Every task I do is time stolen from architecture. Delegation compounds. |
| "They're too busy" | Reality: They can say no. Let them manage their workload. |

**Your job**: Add real outcomes to this table as you delegate. Build your evidence.

## Delegation Patterns

### Start Small
- Week 1: Delegate 1-2 small tasks
- Week 2: Delegate 2-3 tasks
- Week 3: Delegate 3-5 tasks (steady state)

### Scaffold Down
- First time: High touch (walkthrough, review together, frequent check-ins)
- Second time: Medium touch (resources available, follow-up meeting)
- Third time: Low touch (trust, check in only if needed)

### Delegate Categories, Not Just Tasks
- "You own all [type of review] going forward"
- "You're the go-to person for [domain]"
- This is more empowering than task-by-task delegation

## When Delegation "Fails"

### Common "Failures" (That Aren't Really Failures)
1. **They ask questions** → This is learning, not failure
2. **It takes them longer** → Expected at first, improves with practice
3. **They do it differently than you** → That's okay, as long as it meets success criteria
4. **You need to course-correct** → Guidance is part of delegation

### Actual Failures (Rare)
1. **They don't do it at all** → Follow up, understand why, reassess
2. **They repeatedly miss deadlines** → Address performance issue
3. **Quality is consistently poor** → More training needed, or wrong person

**Key**: Most delegation "failures" are actually learning opportunities. Don't use rare true failures to justify not delegating.

## Delegation Checklist

Before delegating:
- [ ] Task clearly defined
- [ ] Context prepared (why, how, success criteria)
- [ ] Right person identified
- [ ] Follow-up date set

During delegation conversation:
- [ ] Used script/framework
- [ ] Checked for understanding
- [ ] Offered support
- [ ] Set expectations

After delegation:
- [ ] Documented in delegation_log.md
- [ ] Calendar reminder for follow-up
- [ ] Tracked anxiety vs. outcome

## Delegation Philosophy

**Remember**:
- Delegation isn't avoiding work - it's enabling the right work
- Every task you do that someone else should do is time stolen from architecture
- You can't build an "island of competency" without developing your team
- Your job is to guide, review, and develop - not to do everything

**The Goal**:
- You: Focus on architecture, strategy, and development
- Team: Owns execution, grows capabilities, becomes self-sufficient
- Together: Build something excellent
