## Whiteboard Sketch Style
**Style Description:** Hand-Drawn Analog Whiteboard Sketch

### 1. Overall Aesthetic and Background
The image should simulate a photograph or scan of a real, physical whiteboard.
*   **Background:** Not a pure digital white; it should be an off-white or very light gray with subtle textures simulating an erased dry-erase surface, including faint smudges, eraser streaks, and slight imperfections.
*   **Frame:** The entire composition must be enclosed within a thick, hand-drawn black marker border, representing the frame of the whiteboard.

### 2. Linework and Texture
All elements—text, boxes, arrows, and icons—must appear to be hand-drawn with dry-erase markers.
*   **Lines:** Should not be vector-perfect. They must have a slight wobble, varying thickness mimicking pressure, and distinct start/stop points.
*   **Fills:** Colored areas should not be solid digital fills. They should exhibit a "scribbled" or streaky texture, showing the marker strokes and the whiteboard beneath, giving a hurried, sketched appearance.

### 3. Typography
All text must look like hand-printed marker writing.
*   **Main Titles:** Large, bold, hand-drawn sans-serif lettering. A signature element is a loose, sketched shadow or highlight applied behind or slightly offset from the black outline, typically using blue and/or purple marker (seen distinctly in almost all title slides).
*   **Subtitles and Body Text:** Smaller, legible, hand-printed sans-serif writing, primarily in black marker.
*   **Emphasis:** Use underlining, scribbled circles, or boxes drawn around text for emphasis, rather than bolding or italics.

### 4. Color Palette
Restrict colors to a standard set of dry-erase markers.
*   **Primary:** Black (for most text and outlines), Blue, and Purple (used heavily for title accents, arrows, and containers).
*   **Secondary/Highlight:** Red (for "stop," error, or "Red Team" concepts), Green (for "go," success, or checkmarks), and Yellow/Orange (for lightbulbs, caution, or highlights).

### 5. Iconography and Visual Elements
Visuals should be simplified cartoons with heavy outlines.
*   **Figures:** Simple "stick-figure plus" style—round heads, simple shapes for bodies, expressive but basic facial features (smiley, frowning, confused with question marks).
*   **Objects:** Literal interpretations of concepts sketched simply (e.g., gears for processing, a brain for AI, a physical toolbox for tactics, documents with squiggly lines for text).
*   **Connectors:** Arrows are thick, hand-drawn, and crucial for showing flow. Boxes and thought bubbles have wobbly, sketched borders.

## Refined Technical Blueprint
**Style Description:** A professional, high-tech engineering schematic adapted for clear presentation visibility. It balances a complex technical feel with high legibility, avoiding the clutter often associated with raw blueprints. The look is precise, constructed, and glowing.

### 1. Overall Aesthetic and Background
The aesthetic is a professional, high-tech engineering schematic, precise, constructed, and glowing.
*   **Background Color:** Deep technical blue (e.g., indigo, midnight blue).
*   **Background Texture:** Subtle, fine white grid pattern overlaid with faint, technical schematic drawings, faint circuitry traces, or architectural lines. These background elements should have low opacity to avoid competing with foreground content.

### 2. Frames and Containers
Every distinct section of the slide (titles, main content panels, sub-panels, speaker name block) is enclosed in a dedicated "engineered" container.
*   **Border Style:** Not simple rectangles; they feature technical details such as beveled or chamfered corners, double framing lines, decorative rivets, screws, compass points, or gear motifs integrated into the corners.
*   **Appearance:** Borders appear to be glowing white or light cyan, looking like etched glass or illuminated technical displays.

### 3. Typography
All text is designed for high legibility against the deep blue background.
*   **Primary Text Color:** High-contrast bright white.
*   **Font Style:** Clean, bold, modern sans-serif fonts throughout. Titles are large and prominent.
*   **Accent Colors:** Used sparingly for emphasis (e.g., status indicators, checks/X's). Colors like glowing green, warning red, or electric yellow are used but maintain a technical, illuminated feel.

### 4. Graphic Elements and Iconography
Visuals are stylized and technical.
*   **Icons:** Stylized, flat technical illustrations (e.g., gears, robot heads, servers, documents with magnifying glasses) that match the glowing white/cyan aesthetic.
*   **Arrows and Connectors:** Large, stylized technical flow arrows with distinct arrowheads, looking like components of a machine rather than simple lines.

### 5. Layout Principles
The layout emphasizes clean organization and clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Padding:** Ample padding within containers ensures text does not feel crowded.
*   **Title Block:** A dedicated technical Title Block frame is positioned at the top.
*   **Metadata Block:** A consistent, smaller technical block is located in the bottom-right corner for speaker attribution/slide metadata.

## Vintage Techno-Botanical Scientific Plate
**Style Description:** A hand-drawn, 19th-century scientific illustration plate combining organic botany with integrated technical or abstract concepts, presented on aged parchment.

### 1. Overall Aesthetic & Medium
The imagery should emulate a hand-drawn, 19th-century scientific illustration plate found in an antique textbook.
*   **Medium:** A combination of traditional ink line art for structure and shading (using cross-hatching and dot work) and watercolor washes for color. The look must feel analog, organic, and aged, avoiding digital crispness or vector perfection.

### 2. Background & Texture
*   **Background:** Always aged parchment or vellum paper. It should feature visible texture, sepia toning, slight water stains, foxing (small brown spots), and worn or slightly darkened edges to convey antiquity.

### 3. Subject Matter Fusion (The Core Concept)
The central focus is the seamless metaphorical blending of organic botany with technical or abstract concepts.
*   **Botanical Base:** The structure is rooted in natural forms—trees, complex root systems, flowering plants, vines, and leaves, rendered with attention to biological detail (veins, serrated edges, bark texture).
*   **Technological Integration:** Mechanical or conceptual elements must be organically integrated into the plant biology. Gears should appear to grow like flowers, circuits should line leaves like veins, roots should flow into data blocks, and tools (magnifying glasses, blueprints) should hang from branches like fruit. The technology should look like part of the natural growth, not just stuck on top.

### 4. Color Palette
The palette is muted, earthy, and naturalistic, heavily influenced by the sepia tone of the paper.
*   **Greens:** Olive, moss, and desaturated forest greens.
*   **Browns:** Sepia, burnt umber, and warm wood tones.
*   **Accents:** Muted ochre yellows, burnt oranges, dusty reds, and occasionally soft, desaturated blues for technological "glows" or water elements.
*   **Black:** Soft, ink-like blacks for outlines and text.

### 5. Typography & Labeling
Text elements must match the vintage scientific aesthetic.
*   **Titles:** Main slide titles should be in ornate, old-fashioned calligraphic or ornamental serif scripts.
*   **Subtitles & Labels:** Use slightly simpler, aged serif fonts that resemble traditional letterpress printing or hand-lettering.
*   **Labeling Conventions:** Use botanical labeling techniques, such as dotted lines or curved arrows pointing to specific parts. Use decorative banners or scrolls to contain group titles within the illustration. Include "Figure" notations (e.g., "Fig. 1: [Description]") in a corner, resembling a textbook caption.

### 6. Composition & Framing
*   **Frame:** Each slide should be framed by a decorative, organic border made of flowing vines, acanthus leaves, or flourishes that match the illustration style. The layout should feel balanced but organic, centered around the main metaphorical illustration.

## Renaissance Technical Sketchbook on Aged Parchment
**Style Description:** A page torn from a Renaissance-era inventor’s sketchbook, specifically emulating the technical and analytical style of Leonardo da Vinci. The medium is monotone sepia ink applied to an antique surface. The look should feel hand-drawn, studied, and ancient, not digitally created.

*   **Aesthetic:** The overarching aesthetic is that of a page torn from a Renaissance-era inventor’s sketchbook, specifically emulating the technical and analytical style of Leonardo da Vinci. The medium is monotone sepia ink applied to an antique surface. The look should feel hand-drawn, studied, and ancient, not digitally created.

### 2. Background Texture
*   **Canvas:** Heavily textured aged parchment or vellum.
*   **Color Palette:** Deep cream, antique yellow, and varied shades of sepia brown.
*   **Imperfections:** Significant signs of wear, including creases, folds, water damage stains, foxing (small brown age spots), ink smudges, and rough, worn edges. It should look tactile and centuries old.

### 3. Drawing & Illustration Style
*   **Ink Style:** All visual elements must be rendered as hand-drawn ink sketches. Monochromatic sepia or dark brown ink. Lines should range from fine, scratchy sketch lines to bolder outlines.
*   **Shading:** Shadows and depth are created exclusively through traditional cross-hatching and line work, not solid color fills or gradients.
*   **Subject Matter Treatment:** Whether depicting people, abstract concepts, or machines, the approach is analytical. Subjects are often shown in cutaway views, revealing internal gears, pulleys, scaffolding, and complex mechanical guts. There is a strong focus on engineering, anatomy, and architecture.
*   **Supporting Elements:** Main illustrations are surrounded by faint geometric construction lines, compass marks, and smaller, secondary study sketches.

### 4. Typography & Text
*   **Titles/Headers:** Rendered in ornate, decorative Renaissance-era calligraphy with flourishes.
*   **Body/Label Text:** A highly legible, antique serif font that resembles early printing or very neat formal script. It must be clear enough to read easily but still feel historical.
*   **Annotations:** Scattered around the illustrations are handwritten notes, observations, and labels in a hurried, cursive script (occasionally including da Vinci-esque "mirror writing").

### 5. Framing
*   Every composition is enclosed within an elaborate, hand-drawn ornamental filigree border composed of acanthus leaves, scrolls, and classical motifs, rendered in the same sepia ink style.

## Sumi-e & Washi (Japanese Ink Wash and Rice Paper)
### 1. Overall Aesthetic
*   **Mood:** Tranquil, sophisticated, organic, and artistic.
*   **Approach:** Presents modern concepts through traditional Japanese hand-painted media, avoiding harsh digital lines, flat colors, or glossy finishings. Every element should feel handcrafted and natural.

### 2. Background and Canvas
*   **Material:** Textured Japanese washi or rice paper, natural, matte off-white or warm cream color.
*   **Texture:** Visible fibers, slight paper grain, organic, absorbent appearance; subtle undulations or texture variations.
*   **Borders:** "Deckled" or irregular, torn edges, giving the impression of a handmade sheet of paper.

### 3. Typography
*   **Style:** Traditional Japanese brush calligraphy (shodō).
*   **Appearance:** Hand-painted with deep black ink, visible variations in stroke width, brush pressure (thick/thin lines), slight ink bleeds, and organic imperfections.

### 4. Color Palette
*   **Inspiration:** Natural pigments and traditional inks, applied as watercolor washes with transparency, gradients, and natural "bloom" or granulation.
*   **Primary:** Deep Sumi-e black (ink gray tones for lighter washes).
*   **Secondary (Nature):** Indigo blue (water/sky), Moss green and Pine green (foliage), Sakura (cherry blossom) soft pink.
*   **Accents:** Muted earthy browns (wood/ground), occasional soft, muted gold wash for highlights or energy.

### 5. Illustration and Iconography Style
*   **Technique:** Hybrid of black ink outlines (sumi-e) and watercolor washes.
*   **Outlines:** Expressive, flowing black ink brushstrokes.
*   **Coloring:** Loose watercolor fills; color may bleed over edges or leave white space for a hand-painted feel.
*   **Subject Matter Treatment:** Technical or modern subjects rendered organically (e.g., watercolor painting of a blueprint, diffused watercolor blooms for "glowing" elements).

## Modern Clean Material Infographic
**Style Description:** A clean, minimalist, and professional aesthetic designed for maximum clarity and approachable data visualization. It utilizes a soft, harmonious color palette and geometric shapes enhanced by subtle depth effects, resembling layered paper or "material design." The look is airy, organized, and friendly, prioritizing easy digestion of structured information.

### 1. Overall Aesthetic and Background
*   **Aesthetic:** The aesthetic is minimalist, bright, and airy.
*   **Background Color:** Pure white (#FFFFFF) or extremely pale light gray.
*   **Background Texture:** None. The background is clean, flat, and devoid of patterns or gradients to ensure maximal contrast with foreground elements.

### 2. Color Palette and Depth
*   **Color Usage:** Color is used strategically for coding and visual interest, avoiding harsh tones.
*   **Accent Colors:** A harmonious palette of soft pastels to mid-tones. Common examples include mint green, sky blue, soft coral/salmon, sunny yellow, and muted lavender. Each distinct section or step usually holds one primary accent color.
*   **Depth Effect (Key Feature):** Elements are not entirely flat. Containers, circles, and arrows feature soft, diffused drop shadows, giving them a slight "lift" off the white background, creating a clean, layered paper or 3D effect.

### 3. Shapes and Containers
*   **Data Organization:** Data is organized into distinct, modular geometric forms.
*   **Shape Types:** Dominant shapes are circles, rounded rectangles, lozenges, hexagons, and soft-edged chevrons or arrows. Sharp corners are rare.
*   **Container Styling:** Content boxes are often pure white with a subtle shadow, bordered or accented by the section's theme color. Some elements are solid colored shapes (like numbered circles in a process flow).

### 4. Typography
*   **Readability:** Text is designed for quick scanning and readability.
*   **Font Style:** Clean, modern, standard sans-serif fonts throughout (e.g., Helvetica Neue, Montserrat, or similar).
*   **Hierarchy and Color:**
    *   **Titles/Headers:** Bold, often in dark gray (e.g., #333333) or matching the section's accent color. Frequently uses all-caps for short labels (e.g., "STEP 01", "ANALYSIS").
    *   **Body Text:** Dark gray or soft black for high readability without the harshness of pure black.

### 5. Graphic Elements and Iconography
*   **Visuals:** Visuals are simple and supportive of the data flow.
*   **Icons:** Minimalist, thin-line icons or simple flat-fill icons. They are almost always contained within a circle, usually colored white against a colored background circle, or colored against a white background circle.
*   **Connectors and Flow:** Flow is emphasized heavily. Connectors include dashed lines, dotted curved paths, and distinct arrow shapes that guide the eye clearly from one module to the next.

### 6. Layout Principles
*   **Modularity:** The layout emphasizes modularity and breathing room.
*   **White Space:** Generous use of negative space (padding/margins) between elements so nothing feels crowded.
*   **Structure:** Slides are structured around clear models: linear timelines, cyclical processes, segmented pyramids, or distinct grouped data points. The sequence is usually explicitly stated with numbers (01, 02, 03, etc.).

## Overlay Glassy
**Style Description:** A modern, high-tech aesthetic characterized by transparent, glowing glass elements overlaid on a dark, futuristic background. The style creates a sense of depth, dimensionality, and light, combining a clean digital interface with an immersive, atmospheric feel.

*   **Background Color:** A dark, deep blue to purple gradient.
*   **Background Texture:** A smooth, dark gradient with subtle light effects. It may feature faint, glowing abstract data points, lines, or subtle light particles that add depth without being distracting.

### 2. Frames and Containers
Content is presented within distinct, transparent glass-like containers.
*   **Appearance:** Containers have the appearance of glowing, frosted glass with a subtle glow around the edges. They are transparent, allowing the background gradient to show through, which enhances the layered, three-dimensional effect.
*   **Border Style:** Borders are often rounded and appear to be made of glowing light, sometimes with a subtle blue or purple neon effect.

### 3. Typography
Text is designed for high legibility against the dark, glowing background.
*   **Primary Text Color:** High-contrast white.
*   **Font Style:** Clean, modern sans-serif fonts are used throughout. Titles are large, prominent, and bold.
*   **Accent Colors:** Accent colors like glowing blue, cyan, purple, and magenta are used for emphasis, bullet points, and graphical elements. Status indicators, such as for an error, might use a glowing red.

### 4. Graphic Elements and Iconography
Visuals are stylized to match the glassy, glowing aesthetic.
*   **Icons:** Icons are stylized, glowing, and appear to be made of light or glass. They are often contained within glowing glass circles or badges.
*   **Arrows and Connectors:** Arrows and flow lines are large, glowing, and stylized, appearing as beams of light or translucent, glowing paths.
*   **Images and Data Visualization:** Images and data charts are often integrated into the glass containers, sometimes with a glowing border or overlay. 3D elements like hands holding devices or abstract shapes are also rendered with a glowing, digital finish.

### 5. Layout Principles
The layout emphasizes a clean, modern organization with a clear hierarchy.
*   **Padding:** Ample padding within and around the glass containers ensures a clean, uncluttered look.
*   **Structure:** Slides are often structured with a main title block, followed by content organized into distinct glass panels or a central glowing graphic element. The use of layers creates a sense of depth.
