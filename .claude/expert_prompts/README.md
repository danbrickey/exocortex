### File Naming Convention

All individual profile files follow the pattern: `[first-name]-[last-name].md`

Examples:
- `dan-brickey.md` (Human lead)
- `kanchana-talaivar.md` (Team manager)
- `atlas-banna.md` (Architecture lead)

### Metadata Standards

Each individual profile file includes:
- **Complete frontmatter** with role, team section, nicknames, and aliases
- **Personal profile** with personality, tone, and professional approach
- **Role definition** with specific responsibilities
- **Core expertise domains** with detailed technical capabilities
- **Collaboration style** (where applicable)

### Integration with Main Profiles

These individual files are extracted from:
- **Source**: `../ai-expert-team-profiles.md` (complete 700+ line profiles)
- **Brief Version**: `../ai-expert-team-brief-profiles.md` (concise team overview)

Updates to individual files should be synchronized with the main profiles document.

### Context Management Benefits

1. **Token Efficiency**: Load only relevant specialists for specific tasks
2. **Focused Consultation**: Target expertise areas without information overload  
3. **Modular Updates**: Maintain individual personas independently
4. **Specialized Workflows**: Create domain-specific AI assistant configurations
5. **Development Agility**: Iterate on specific personas without affecting others

---

**Document Maintenance**: Individual profile files should be kept synchronized with the main team profiles document. Updates to personas should be reflected across all related files.

**Version Control**: Each individual file maintains its own version tracking while referencing the master profiles version for consistency.

**Usage Recommendation**: For most general team interactions, use the brief profiles. For deep expertise consultation, load specific individual profiles as needed.
