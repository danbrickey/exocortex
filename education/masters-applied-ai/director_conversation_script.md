### Key Messages to Land
1. **I'm pursuing a master's in AI** (Fall 2026 start)
2. **This is the natural evolution** of the data platform work we're doing
3. **I'm already delivering AI value** (team productivity, Cortex POC, training)
4. **I need to create capacity** through delegation over next few months
5. **I'd love your support** as I work through this transition
6. **Eventually want to connect with David (CIO)** about AI strategy alignment

## The Script

### Opening (Set the Context)
> "Hey Ram, I wanted to share something I've been working on that affects my career direction and I think could benefit our team and the EDP work we're doing."

**Pause for acknowledgment** - let him respond or nod

---

### The Vision (Your "Why")
> "I'm pursuing a master's degree in Applied AI starting Fall 2026. I know that might sound like a big shift, but honestly, it feels like the natural evolution of everything we've been building with the EDP."
>
> [Brief pause]
>
> "AI doesn't replace what we're doing—it makes it exponentially more valuable. All the data quality work, the governance frameworks, the integration patterns we've built—that's the foundation AI needs. I want to be the architect who designs how we leverage AI on top of what we've built."

**Key phrases to emphasize**:
- "Natural evolution" (this resonates deeply with you)
- "Foundation AI needs" (your expertise is the prerequisite)
- "Architect who designs" (your role, elevated)

---

### What You're Already Doing (Proof + Value)
> "I'm already doing this work, honestly. You've probably seen the team's productivity improvements since I introduced them to Claude Code and Copilot—they're documenting faster, writing better code, debugging more efficiently."
>
> [Specific example he can verify]
>
> "I'm working on a Snowflake Cortex POC to see how we can use AI for [document classification / semantic search for EDP docs / anomaly detection]. And I'm training myself on ML fundamentals through Andrew Ng's specialization on Coursera."
>
> [Land this point]
>
> "This isn't theoretical interest—I'm building real capability here."

**Evidence to reference if needed**:
- Claude Code adoption by team
- GitHub Copilot usage
- Productivity metrics (if you have them)
- Cortex POC in progress

---

### What You Need (The Ask)
> "Here's what I need over the next few months: I need to create some capacity to pursue this seriously—both the learning side and the hands-on application work."
>
> "I'm working through some delegation opportunities to free up time. [If you have specifics: "For example, I'm looking at delegating X to Y because they're ready for it and it's good leadership development for them."]"
>
> [The collaborative ask]
>
> "I wanted you to be aware of this, and I'd love your support as I work through this transition. I think it positions our team really well for where data platforms are heading, and I want to make sure I'm doing this in a way that keeps our current work moving forward."

**Key elements**:
- "Create capacity" (not "take time away from work")
- "Delegation" (leadership development, win-win)
- "I'd love your support" (invitation, not demand)
- "Keeps our current work moving" (reassurance)

---

### The Bigger Picture (Blue Cross Strategy)
> "Eventually, I'd like to have a conversation with David about how this aligns with Blue Cross's direction on AI. I don't know if we have a formal AI strategy yet, but I think we should—and I'd like to help shape it."
>
> [Show patience and pragmatism]
>
> "For now, I'm focused on building capability and delivering value with the AI work I'm already doing. But I wanted you to know where I'm heading."

**Subtle messages**:
- You're thinking strategically about Blue Cross needs (not just personal goals)
- You want to help shape strategy (offering value)
- You're not demanding immediate CIO meeting (patient, pragmatic)
- You trust Ram with this information (transparency)

---

### Close with Opening for Input
> "What do you think? Does this make sense to you? Any concerns I should be thinking about?"

**Why this works**:
- Invites his perspective (collaborative)
- Opens door for concerns you can address
- Shows you value his input
- Doesn't wait for "approval" but invites partnership

## Likely Responses & How to Handle

### Response 1: "This sounds great, how can I help?"
**Your reply**:
> "Thanks, I appreciate that. Main thing right now is awareness and support as I work through delegation. And down the road, helping me get some face time with David to talk about AI strategy would be great."

**Follow-up if he offers more**:
> "I'll keep you updated on the Cortex POC and any other AI work I'm doing. I'd love your feedback as I build this out."

---

### Response 2: "How will this affect your EDP work?"
**Your reply**:
> "Good question. I'm being intentional about creating capacity through delegation, not just adding more to my plate. And honestly, the AI work I'm doing is directly applicable to EDP—Cortex POC, AI governance frameworks, team enablement. A lot of this work feeds both directions."
>
> [Reassurance]
>
> "I'm not taking time away from EDP, I'm evolving what EDP can do."

**If he needs more specifics**:
> "The master's program is part-time online, designed for working professionals. I'll be taking 2 courses per semester while working full-time. It's designed for exactly this scenario."

---

### Response 3: "Have you talked to David about this?"
**Your reply**:
> "Not yet. I wanted to start with you since we work so closely together. I will definitely want to talk with David at some point, especially about how this connects to Blue Cross's AI direction. But I'm not in a rush—I want to show value first with the work I'm already doing."

**If he offers to facilitate**:
> "That would be great, thank you. Let me get a bit further along—maybe after I complete the Cortex POC and can show something concrete. Then it would be good timing to talk with David about the bigger picture."

---

### Response 4: "What if Blue Cross doesn't invest in AI?"
**Your reply**:
> "That's a fair question. Honestly, I think AI is where data platforms are going regardless—every vendor we work with (Snowflake, dbt, etc.) is building AI capabilities. So even if Blue Cross doesn't make a big AI investment, this makes me better at my current job."
>
> [Honest but constructive]
>
> "But I also think we'd be missing an opportunity if we don't lean into this. That's part of why I want to have the conversation with David eventually—to understand where we're headed and potentially help shape that direction."

---

### Response 5: "That's a lot. Are you sure you can handle it?"
**Your reply**:
> "It is a lot, you're right. That's why I'm being thoughtful about it. The master's program is part-time online, designed for working professionals. I'm starting the learning now so I'm prepared. And I'm deliberately creating capacity through delegation—which is good leadership development anyway."
>
> [Acknowledge and commit]
>
> "I won't let this impact our EDP delivery, and if I feel like it's getting to be too much, I'll adjust. But I need to do this—I can't watch this AI transformation happen from the sidelines."

**The last line is key**: Shows your passion and need without being defensive.

---

### Response 6: "What's the timeline?"
**Your reply**:
> "I'm applying to UVU's MS in Applied AI program in January, for a Fall 2026 start. Between now and then, I'm building foundational skills—ML fundamentals, Python for AI, Snowflake Cortex capabilities. And I'm doing hands-on work with the Cortex POC and team AI enablement."
>
> "During the program—Fall 2026 through Spring 2028—I'll be working full-time and going to school part-time. The program is designed for exactly that. And I plan to use our EDP work as the 'lab' for my coursework, so everything I'm learning will directly apply here."

---

### Response 7: "Who are you thinking of delegating to?"
**Your reply (if you have specifics)**:
> "I'm still working through the details, but I'm looking at [specific person] for [specific responsibility] because [they're ready for it / good development opportunity / plays to their strengths]. I'll be intentional about setting them up for success with proper knowledge transfer and support."

**Your reply (if you don't have specifics yet)**:
> "I'm still working through the specifics, but I have a few team members who are ready for more responsibility. I'll come back to you with a delegation plan once I've thought it through more carefully. I want to make sure I'm setting people up for success."

---

### Response 8: Silence or Skepticism
**If he's quiet or seems skeptical**:
> "I can tell you might have some concerns. What are you thinking?"

**Then listen** - really listen. Address his concerns directly, don't be defensive.

**If he's hesitant**:
> "I understand this is a lot to take in. I'm not asking for any decisions right now—I just wanted you to be aware of where I'm heading. Let's keep talking about this as I make progress."
