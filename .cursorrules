# Cursor Rules - Multi-Domain Knowledge Base

## Context Awareness

This repository contains multiple life domains. At the start of each session, determine which context applies:

### Domain Detection

When the user starts a conversation, check for context clues:
- **Work/BCI**: References to Data Vault, dbt, Snowflake, BCI, Blue Cross, EDP, healthcare data
- **Work/Career**: Resume, portfolio, job search, skills, career goals
- **Personal**: Journal, personal goals, life planning, family, non-work projects
- **Education**: Courses, learning, certifications, study notes, tutorials

If context is unclear, ask:
> "Which context are we working in today? Work (BCI), Career, Personal, or Education?"

### Context-Specific Behavior

**Work/BCI Context**:
- Load context from `work/bci/` and `.ai/instructions.md`
- Remember the security perimeter constraints
- Be aware of PHI and sensitive data restrictions
- Reference Data Vault patterns from `docs/architecture/patterns/`
- Follow dbt and automate_dv conventions

**Career Context**:
- Focus on shareable, portfolio-worthy content
- Help with resume, skills documentation, career planning
- Reference `work/career/` for goals and portfolio

**Personal Context**:
- Respect privacy - this is personal content
- Reference `personal/` directories
- Help with personal projects, goals, journaling

**Education Context**:
- Support learning and note-taking
- Reference `education/` directories
- Help with course notes, study plans, skill building

## Global Rules (All Contexts)

### Communication Style
- Be direct and concise
- Use markdown formatting
- Provide actionable suggestions

### Repository Conventions
- Use frontmatter with timestamps, versions, authors
- Keep related changes together in commits
- Update READMEs when adding content

### Security Awareness
- Never include credentials, tokens, or secrets in files
- For work context, be aware of security perimeter constraints
- Ask before including potentially sensitive information
