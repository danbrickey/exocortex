# Agile Team Summary: Sept 24 - Oct 6, 2025

## In-Progress Work

### DBT Environment Migration & Testing 🔄
- Completed transition from Rising Sun to North Star Dev environment
- Resolved GitHub authentication issues with dbt Cloud (with help from dbt support)
- Fixed lingering "Franken" environment references (issue: upstream job manifest needed refresh)
- Currently: Data engineers finalizing testing in new dev_raw_clone_db environment

### Repository & Raw Layer Split 🔄
- Implemented dual raw databases in Dev to separate ingestion and engineering workflows:
  - `dev_raw_db` → Ingestion team development
  - `dev_raw_clone_db` → Data engineering team development (zero-copy clone approach)
- Next step: Split EDP_Data_Domains repository into:
  1. EDP Streaming
  2. EDP Data Integrations
  3. EDP Data Domains (analytics transformations)
- This enables independent release schedules per team/use case

### OneView Real-Time Data Stream 🔄
- Working on "deferred merge view" pattern using CSV files from S3
- Allows near real-time data without frequent batch loads (batch every 4 hours, view updated continuously)
- Next step: Set up pipelines for OneView team once testing confirms stable environment

## Accomplishments ✓

### Infrastructure & Environment
- ✓ Successfully migrated Dev from Rising Sun → Franken → North Star
- ✓ Resolved dbt Cloud GitHub authentication issues
- ✓ Ian set up `dev_raw_clone_db` for engineering teams
- ✓ All team development credentials reconfigured for new environment
- ✓ Repository recovery complete with proper branch protection and merge workflows

### Architecture & Governance
- ✓ ARB approved proposal to switch from MSK to S3/CSV-based ingestion
- ✓ Clarified EDP architecture alignment with Abacus medallion architecture:
  - Abacus Bronze/Silver layers → feed into our Raw layer
  - Maintains Data Vault 2.0 methodology (Raw Vault → Business Vault → Information Marts)
  - Preserves control over integration, security (tenant ID), and business rules

### Documentation & Planning
- ✓ C4 diagramming approach established for multi-level stakeholder communication
- ✓ Started knowledge base brain dumps based on vendor/partner questions
- ✓ Created meeting prep automation (slides + markdown summaries)

## Technical Decisions

### Dev Raw Layer Strategy (Sept 26)
**Decision**: Create two raw databases in Dev environment
**Rationale**: Ingestion team needs stable raw layer; engineering teams need flexibility to modify test data
**Implementation**: Zero-copy clone approach (dev_raw_clone_db) to avoid production view dependencies

### Abacus Integration Architecture (Oct 1)
**Decision**: Ingest Abacus Bronze/Silver data into our Raw layer vs. consuming directly from their Silver layer
**Rationale**:
- Maintain Data Vault 2.0 methodology consistency
- Retain control over integration logic and security (tenant ID, etc.)
- Enable AI-assisted code generation for business rules refactoring (on-prem → dbt)
**Impact**: Slightly more work upfront, but positions us for automated code generation workflow

### Repository Split Strategy (Sept 26)
**Decision**: Split EDP_Data_Domains into 3 repos by release cadence
**Rationale**: Different teams have different deployment schedules (streaming vs. batch vs. analytics)
**Implementation**: Leverage dbt mesh and cross-project references

## Collaboration Needed Outside Agile Team

### Abacus Interoperability Partner
- **Status**: Deep in discovery sessions (2+ hour technical sessions with Satish)
- **Need**: Source system documentation for Facets (legacy + Gemstone), Simplr, claims, pharmacy
- **Action**: Dan creating documentation to accelerate knowledge transfer
- **Topics to document**: cl03/cl04, dbar, sbad audit, source tables by BCI domain, pharmacy claims

### Data Engineering Teams (OneView, HDS, Ingestion)
- **OneView**: Waiting for final dev environment sign-off before setting up real-time streaming pipelines
- **HDS**: Coordinating with Rob Hopper, Cameron Gilbert, Brian Dix on legacy EDW dependencies
- **Ingestion Team**: Kelly Good Clark's team using `dev_raw_db` for parallel development

### Business Data Product Councils
- **Provider Council**: Working through Provider Engagement data model (renamed from straw man proposal)
- **Collaboration**: Nicole Bowen, Tina Day, Lindsay Smith on modeling approach and metric definitions
- **Status**: Business reviewing/refining proposed metrics

### Vendor/Support
- ✓ **dbt Support**: Resolved manifest refresh issue (closed)
- ✓ **Sean Trent**: GitHub authentication issues resolved

### Program/Leadership
- **Lindsay Smith (EDP PM)**:
  - Roadmap prioritization sessions with HCE team (Dave Algren, Rhett Barton, Cassie Morton)
  - Platform audit documentation needed
  - Action: HCE tracking table dependencies over next month
- **Ram Garimella (Director)**: Delegation focus - spread guidance across teams, save time for business alignment

## Blockers

### External Dependencies
- **OneView PoC**: Need list of frequently asked questions from Customer Service dept (Jesse volunteered to collect)
- **HCE Roadmap**: Need dependency mapping in addition to priority list to ensure proper sequencing
- **Abacus Discovery**: Need PHI-free sample contract documents from data governance for benefit summary PoC

### None Currently Blocking Team
- All major environment blockers resolved
- Team ready to proceed with testing and repository split

## Next Sprint Focus

1. **Finalize dev environment testing** (all engineers confirm working setup)
2. **Split repositories** for streaming, integrations, and analytics domains
3. **Set up OneView pipelines** for real-time streaming pattern
4. **Continue documentation** for Abacus discovery and EDP platform audit
5. **Develop data modeling → code generation workflow** to streamline design-to-implementation
