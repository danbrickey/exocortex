## Executive Summary

This career plan outlines the transition from Data & Solutions Architect to AI-native roles across three complementary career paths: AI Solutions Architect, AI Strategist, and AI Coach/Change Management Specialist. The plan leverages current Blue Cross role transformation, UVU master's program (Fall 2026 start), and strategic skill-building to position for AI leadership roles by Spring 2028.

### Revision 2.0 Notes (October 15, 2025)

**Key Changes from v1.0:**
- **UVU Application accelerated**: Application must be submitted by **first week of December 2025** (not January) for early admission priority - admissions counselor confirmed early applications get priority
- **GPA concern strategy**: Undergraduate GPA is 2.96 (below 3.0 threshold) - will proactively address in personal statement emphasizing 25+ years professional experience, leadership accomplishments, and recent AI transformation work at Blue Cross
- **Realistic time allocation acknowledged**: Currently at capacity with 15-20 hours/week work-focused AI time and 10-12 hours/week personal learning time (total 25-30 hours/week for AI transition)
- **Phase 0 added** (Oct-Nov 2025): Dedicated 4-6 weeks to delegation and workflow optimization to create sustainable capacity before ramping up learning
- **External presence activities deferred**: LinkedIn posts, conferences, guest lectures, informational interviews paused until Q1-Q2 2026 when capacity allows
- **Q4 2025 POC scaled back**: Lightweight Cortex exploration or prep work for Q1 2026 POC (not full project)
- **Q1 2026 POC defined**: Contract benefits summarization project (PDF parsing, Cortex AI, summarization for customer service agents) - already scoped with tentative approval, becomes Portfolio Project #1
- **Portfolio expectations adjusted**: Target 2-3 substantial projects (not 3-5+) with emphasis on quality and real business impact
- **Reduced ambition for Oct-Dec 2025**: Focus on foundation (learning, delegation, application) not transformation initiatives

### Current Reality Check (October 2025)

**Time Available:**
- **Work-related AI/learning**: 15-20 hours/week (during work hours, focus time blocks)
- **Personal learning time**: 10-12 hours/week (evenings 1 hour/day M-F, weekends few hours/day)
- **Total AI career transition time**: ~25-30 hours/week

**Current Capacity:**
- Schedule is currently **maxed out** with day-to-day architecture responsibilities
- Need to **delegate and optimize** before ramping up AI initiatives
- **Cannot** add significant new responsibilities without first creating capacity

**Priority Timeline:**
1. **October-November 2025**: Create capacity (delegation, AI workflows)
2. **November-December 2025**: Complete UVU application (submit first week of December)
3. **Q1 2026**: Launch Contract Benefits POC (primary portfolio project)

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium (strong background, but GPA is below threshold)

**Mitigation Strategies in Application:**
- **Personal statement directly addresses GPA**:
  - Acknowledge 2.96 GPA from [decade/institution]
  - Emphasize 25+ years of professional accomplishment since then
  - Highlight continuous learning: certifications, courses, professional development
  - Point to recent AI work (ML Specialization, Cortex cert, Contract Benefits POC) demonstrating current learning ability and motivation
  - Frame as: "25 years ago GPA vs. 25 years of proven data architecture leadership"
- **Strong recommendations** from CIO and Director emphasizing leadership, technical depth, and learning agility
- **Portfolio work** (Contract Benefits POC, Cortex cert, ML Specialization) demonstrates current capability
- **Early application** (first week of December) for priority consideration

**Contingency if Not Accepted:**
- Apply to backup programs:
  - Boise State (local option)
  - Online programs (Georgia Tech OMSCS, UT Austin, Arizona State)
  - Other Utah programs (University of Utah)
- Strengthen application for reapplication:
  - Additional certifications (AWS ML, more coursework)
  - Additional projects (another Blue Cross POC)
  - Request feedback from UVU admissions on what would strengthen application
- Consider deferring for one year and reapplying with even stronger portfolio
- Continue self-directed learning and pursue AI role transition without master's degree (may limit options but still viable)

### Other Risks (Unchanged from v1.0, but noting Phase 0 mitigates Work-School Balance risk)

**Risk: Work-School Balance Too Challenging**
- **Mitigation**: Phase 0 creates 5-10 hours/week capacity; use Blue Cross projects as coursework; lighter work load during heavy semesters
- **Contingency**: Reduce course load (extend program by 1 semester); take semester off if needed; reduce Blue Cross scope temporarily

**Risk: Blue Cross Doesn't Invest in AI**
- **Mitigation**: Build transferable portfolio; maintain external network; document all work
- **Contingency**: Accelerate job search (Fall 2027); leverage master's for external transition

**Risk: AI Job Market Changes**
- **Mitigation**: Build skills across 3 career paths; healthcare domain as differentiator; focus on applied AI
- **Contingency**: Target healthcare-specific AI roles; consider hybrid data+AI roles

**Risk: Burnout from Work + School + Life**
- **Mitigation**: Phase 0 creates sustainable capacity; prioritize ruthlessly; set boundaries; self-care practices
- **Contingency**: Pause external activities; extend master's timeline; reduce work scope with Blue Cross approval; take semester off if severe

## Key Success Factors (Revised)

1. **Sustainable Pace Over Heroic Effort**
   - Phase 0 creates capacity for the long haul (2.5+ years)
   - 25-30 hours/week for AI transition is sustainable, 40-50 hours is not
   - Work-school-life balance is essential for multi-year program

2. **Integration of Work, School, and Career Goals**
   - Blue Cross work feeds portfolio, portfolio feeds coursework, coursework feeds career preparation
   - No duplication of effort - everything serves multiple purposes
   - Contract Benefits POC becomes case study for multiple courses and capstone

3. **Quality Over Quantity in Portfolio**
   - One excellent project (Contract Benefits POC) > three mediocre projects
   - Real-world business impact and metrics are critical
   - Documentation quality matters (architecture diagrams, ROI analysis, lessons learned)

4. **Strategic UVU Application**
   - Early submission (first week of December) for admission priority
   - Direct, confident address of GPA concern in personal statement
   - Strong recommendations emphasizing professional accomplishments
   - Portfolio work (Cortex cert, ML Specialization progress) demonstrates current capability

5. **Adaptability and Regular Review**
   - Monthly reviews to catch issues early
   - Willingness to adjust plan based on learnings
   - Keep end goal in mind while being flexible on path
   - If something isn't working, change it quickly

6. **Realistic Expectations for External Presence**
   - External visibility (LinkedIn, conferences, guest lectures) is **nice-to-have**, not **must-have**
   - Primary focus: learning, Blue Cross transformation, master's degree
   - External presence can ramp up post-graduation when capacity is greater
   - Quality of portfolio work matters more than social media presence
