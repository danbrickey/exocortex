## 🥇 #1: AI Solutions Architect
**Current Fit: 80-85%** | **Post-Master's Fit: 95%**

### Why This is Your Best Match

**Alignment with Your Strengths:**
- **Enterprise Architecture Background**: You've designed end-to-end data platforms for 130+ sources - this is exactly what AI Solutions Architects do, but with AI/ML workloads
- **Cross-Functional Translation**: Your ability to work with business stakeholders, EAs, and engineering teams is the core skill for this role
- **Healthcare Domain Expertise**: Complex, regulated industry experience is a massive differentiator in AI solutions (bias mitigation, privacy, explainability)
- **Technical Credibility Without Coding Focus**: You can "talk the talk" with ML Engineers but focus on architecture/strategy (perfect for your preference to move away from hands-on coding)
- **Teaching Experience**: Solutions Architects spend significant time educating clients on AI capabilities - your adjunct professor background is a unique advantage

**What This Role Actually Does:**
- Design AI/ML solutions for enterprise customers (e.g., "How do we build a claims fraud detection system using Snowflake Cortex + custom models?")
- Translate business problems into technical architecture (AI model selection, data pipelines, deployment patterns)
- Guide clients through AI readiness assessments (data quality, governance, infrastructure)
- Work with sales teams to scope AI engagements
- Bridge gap between AI researchers/ML engineers and business stakeholders

### Gap Analysis

**Strengths You Already Have:**
- ✅ Enterprise data architecture (medallion, data vault, dimensional modeling)
- ✅ Cloud platform expertise (Snowflake, AWS, dbt)
- ✅ Healthcare domain knowledge
- ✅ Cross-functional communication

- 🟡 **MLOps Basics**: How models are deployed, monitored, retrained (Snowflake Cortex helps here)
- 🟡 **AI Use Case Portfolio**: Need 2-3 concrete AI projects to discuss in interviews

**Master's Program Will Address:**
- 🎓 Formal ML training (model selection, evaluation metrics, bias detection)
- 🎓 AI project portfolio (capstone projects, hands-on labs)
- 🎓 Credential signal ("MS in Applied AI" removes "does he really know AI?" questions)

### Recommendation: **Pursue All Three Simultaneously**

**Why this works:**

**These roles have 70-80% skill overlap:**
- All three require AI literacy, enterprise data platform knowledge, stakeholder communication, and healthcare domain expertise
- The work you do at Blue Cross to build AI Solutions Architect skills ALSO builds AI Strategist and AI Coach skills

**Different organizations will perceive your background differently:**
- **Tech companies** (Snowflake, Databricks) → AI Solutions Architect
- **Consulting firms** (McKinsey, Deloitte) → AI Strategist
- **Healthcare enterprises** (payers, providers) → could be any of the three, depending on their needs
- **Startups** → might blend all three (small teams need generalists)

**Your resume/portfolio can be "spun" for different audiences:**
- Same projects (Snowflake Cortex demos, AI governance frameworks, team AI training)
- Different emphasis depending on role (architecture vs. strategy vs. enablement)

## 💡 Why This Plan Works

**Strategic Flexibility:**
- You're building skills for all 3 career paths simultaneously
- Blue Cross work = real-world portfolio + leadership visibility
- Master's degree = credential signal + academic depth
- External presence = job market optionality

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Keep Blue Cross job (income stability) while building AI skills
- Transform current role → if Blue Cross invests in AI, you win
- If Blue Cross doesn't invest → you have portfolio to leave

**Healthcare Differentiation:**
- Most AI professionals come from tech/finance backgrounds
- Healthcare is complex, regulated, high-value → your domain expertise is rare
- You can be "the AI architect who understands healthcare" (huge advantage)

**Timing Advantage:**
