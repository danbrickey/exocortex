TranscriptOctober 16, 2025, 3:02PMLorraine Maldonado started transcriptionSathish Dhanasekar   0:05Hello everyone. So I think we let's start. There are two items I think we're waiting on Tamron was one on the. I think this one is to collect to find a business one for this and this one is still done. We'll check the EDP future roadmap for the entity.Entirety of this is for data and think for this one we need Tamarin think do we have which this the meeting?   0:36Yep.Sathish Dhanasekar   0:36Yep. Hey Rich. So this particular source morning. So this particular source came up yesterday like BCD BCPS provided directory. So if it's a provided directory outside of BCA network.Rich Tallon - Contractor   0:39Hey.Sathish Dhanasekar   0:55And if we store that information, do we need to consider this source for 915 provider directory API access API?Go to direct API.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:07Well, so this this would correspond to what I'm I'm reading this that this is the consumption side of the Blue Cross the association provided.Directory, right? So each plan submits data to the association and then the association makes all of the data across all plans available.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:24Mhm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:34So this is the combined Blue Cross provider directory information. So it's not necessarily it's not required for 99115, but there is interest in.In this data.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:55OK. Um.So we can ingest this and OK.So we don't need to ingest this and populate our provider directory in. So this data specifically only give us a provider directly information or holistically all the provider data associated with it.Rich Tallon - Contractor   2:21It it'll give you all of the all of the data for all of the Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.Sathish Dhanasekar   2:32So Rich, what I'm trying to get to is like say this, this is the directory information on like see the location degree or is it like a whole we are getting the whole provider holistic information like provider and provider and NBA and all all of the locations.But.Rich Tallon - Contractor   2:51Yeah so so this is these are you know fire Firebase. So you get all of the you know organization, location, practitioner role etcetera you know practitioner data but it is it is across all of the.Sathish Dhanasekar   3:02OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   3:09It's not just Blue Cross of Idaho, it's all of the Blue Cross plants.Sathish Dhanasekar   3:14OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   3:16And part of some of the use cases driving this are, you know, we need to know when certain providers on other plans are terminated because we have an obligation to say, send out termination notice to members.So there are use cases that are driven by this data, but it's not. The use cases would not be our requirement to surface our provider directory on the fire endpoint.Does that make sense?Sathish Dhanasekar   3:50OK, makes sense. So this would not go to our fire BCF fire endpoint.Rich Tallon - Contractor   3:57Right, we we would not need to basically take this data and then turn around and and surface it on the fire end point.But it is important for businessdriven use cases within Blue Cross of Idaho.Sathish Dhanasekar   4:10OK.OK.Is this here?Nilesh Trivedi   5:35Yes. So that's what I just want to speak, Satish. So we do not require that means we do not. It is. We don't have to consider this BPD in scope at least for 9115 rain drop, right. That is what I understand.Rich Tallon - Contractor   5:47Well, that that's there's two different questions. One is if you're looking at it solely within the you know the requirements of 9115, no. But if if this is if this source is in the contract.+12*******42   5:47Yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   6:00Mhm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   6:06Then there is a high it. It would be considered a high priority source, right? Because there's business needs and compliance, other compliance regulations.That this data would fulfill.Outside of 9115.Nilesh Trivedi   6:26Right, so.Sathish Dhanasekar   6:26So we need to.Nilesh Trivedi   6:29Yeah, so Satish, can you mention we don't need this data provided to API 9115 specifically on our line?Sathish Dhanasekar   6:35Yeah, we don't need this for, we don't need this data published for BCA product API 5, but we do not, we do need to load it for the EDP use case, right? So my challenge, my thinking Nilesh is like if you are ideating F1 model based off this fire data.Based on of this data then wouldn't that also go to our line on file or we can filter it by the source then is that a way that in our?I know feed workflow can be filtered by the source in the same target that we don't want this particular provider to go to the CMS interrupt data guide flow.Nilesh Trivedi   7:24I don't know about the filter Bali. Can you help here? If you are aware about the filter, can we filter it out or not?Kelly Good Clark   7:36What are you? I I guess I don't understand. What is the question about filtering out?Sathish Dhanasekar   7:42So Rich is saying that we do see this is a provider data outside of BC network across healthcare blue plus health plan. Is that Kelly I'm talking to?Kelly Good Clark   7:55Hi, this is Kelly.Sathish Dhanasekar   7:56Yeah, so we Rich confirmed that we don't need to publish this particular BCBS provider directory data to our 9 BCA 915 provider directory API, but there are other use cases within the EDP we we would need to test this data.I'm also assuming we need to populate those FM target table.Kelly Good Clark   8:21Right, Rich? So I don't know like what I'll go ahead, Rich.Rich Tallon - Contractor   8:23Yeah, so.No, it's just so don't confuse it like OK, so the the 9115 requirement basically is for our us to publish our directory, right, like the data that we have on our providers needs to go to the endpoint. So that's you know from.Sathish Dhanasekar   8:41Mhm, mhm.Mhm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   8:47From our data all the way through curation out to the Onyxx FHIR endpoint, right? Now this is the other way, it's the opposite direction, so this would be acquiring.Sathish Dhanasekar   8:52Mhm.Mhm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   9:03The provider directory from the Blue Cross Association curating that, forming it for ingestion within BCI.Sathish Dhanasekar   9:14Right. So I I was unclear about that part. So my my my contention is like, OK, we get this data, do we keep it in the raw edition layer or do we use this data to hydrate our FM models like provider organization?Affiliations and everything else.Rich Tallon - Contractor   9:36Interesting question. There is, you know, there is a plan code, so you could you could you could use some of the master identifiers that the that the association assigns.Sathish Dhanasekar   9:48To yes.Rich Tallon - Contractor   9:51To to basically supplement our data and add those master identifiers.Sathish Dhanasekar   9:52So the.+12*******42   9:53Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   9:55Yeah, see the see that that's what that's where I'm going like do we need to master it or do we do we truly consider that if if if you're considering the foundational mark or any providers within the foundational mark is specific to BCI, then we can keep it, we can very well keep this as a raw.+12*******42   9:58Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   10:14Consumption layer, we consume it, we park it in the branch and then we can we can jump for any specific use cases. Yeah, sorry.+12*******42   10:18Um.So in our in our analytics, there's a pretty good chunk of claims that are not with BCI contracting providers, but they are for our members and those claims are important to us. We typically attach.Sathish Dhanasekar   10:24The.Mhm.+12*******42   10:37the other plans provider ID and plan code to the claim so that we have some information about that out-of-state provider. So we do use it in our analytics. I don't know if it's a requirement for your foundation marks. It's definitely a requirement for our internal analytics.6.Rich Tallon - Contractor   10:59Yeah, let me.+12*******42   11:00So do we not have definitions? Do do you not have definitions of the foundation marks or something? Is that something we have to work on? Sounds like we don't know what the foundation marks are.Sathish Dhanasekar   11:09So we.No, no, we we know the definition for the foundation model. OK, then we we know what data goes into our foundation model like we have. So excuse me, we have both the organization, affiliation, service organizations, providers and Atlas and.We have all this. So question is do we need to populate this data provided directly with our foundational model or not?Rich Tallon - Contractor   11:39Well, I guess the I think the I would lean toward yes and here's why. Because if you're also considering the fact that we have to surface claims and those are out of state claims, then this information of the provider would be.Sathish Dhanasekar   11:52Mhm.This is.Rich Tallon - Contractor   11:59Then important for that out of area claim, right? So I guess from that perspective you can say yes, it is important for surfacing the claim information on the endpoint.+12*******42   12:07Yeah.Yeah.If you want information, if you want to attach provider information to all the rest of the data that we have, then you would need all the providers in theory. Now in house we haven't had the blue provider directory.Before it's. And so what we have used is data that's inside of facets that refers to the the claim record that was ingested from the other plan through our inner plan.System.And.So we use that information which is attached to the claim, but I don't like it. It's kind of messy. That's whatever came in on the claim. So the NPIs are not always right and so on. Sometimes it's a practitioner with a facility NPI attached to them and stuff like that, so.It'd be nicer if we could use the brief provider directory for that purpose.But yeah, if you want provider information attached to all claims, there there will be, I don't know, 20 or 30% of our claims that don't have provider information on them if you ignore the out-of-state providers.Rich Tallon - Contractor   13:12I would lean toward the, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   13:13Mm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   13:24Yeah, I guess I'm leaning toward, yeah, just put it, you know, put it in the foundation model. There's a plan code and you can filter by plan code when needed.+12*******42   13:34But that that goes back to my question, which I didn't feel like was answered, which is.What data goes? Do we know what data goes in the foundation model? Because you're asking us if this data should go in that foundation model. It sounds like we don't have it clearly defined.Sathish Dhanasekar   13:49No we we so if if the which says like OK this this particular data will contain all the service organization, all the application that's similar to what we get in the fire. We know what those data data sets map for foundation model, we know that but we will probably need a data.Oh.Vallimala Palaneeappan   14:11I can add some insight in there Satish. So so far Dan, we haven't loaded any third party provider, so this is considered to be a third party provider rather than an in-house provider directory, right? So technically.Sathish Dhanasekar   14:22Photos.+12*******42   14:30Mm.Vallimala Palaneeappan   14:31Yes, we can load it. Um, the the question we wanted to ask is that could be overlapping providers, right? And how do we want to manage it if we want to?+12*******42   14:39Of course, yeah.There there isn't any way to manage that at the claim level because you have to keep the provider record that was part of the claim with the claim, right? So yes, those can be the same providers with multiple IDs, especially in.Vallimala Palaneeappan   14:42Mhm.Right. And I and I and I don't.+12*******42   14:58Multi-state areas where a bunch of states have population centers that are close by. There will be lots of.It's a it's a many to many relationship. So we would have. So you have to go to the gold record kind of approach and master that if you want to make sense of it.Vallimala Palaneeappan   15:13Exactly. So, yeah.+12*******42   15:19But you still have to have the original provider record with the claim.Vallimala Palaneeappan   15:19Mhm.+12*******42   15:24You know what I mean? You can't just pay the claim to a generic provider record, yeah.Vallimala Palaneeappan   15:24Understood, right. Understood. Uh.I would need. I'm not sure if Joe is here, but I would need Joe's help to understand if provider mastering is in scope and then decide about this. Can we can we, you know, hold off this item until we have have that clarity?+12*******42   15:43Well, I don't. Well, you don't need. You don't need a gold record to attach the provider information to the claim. I don't think provider mastering is required for that.Vallimala Palaneeappan   15:55The downstream needs to do that right when we process a claim.+12*******42   15:56But but what I'm my question is what are we going to?Vallimala Palaneeappan   16:02Um hum.+12*******42   16:02I don't have any vision of what the foundation marks are supposed to answer or whether.Vallimala Palaneeappan   16:06OK, let me put it this way. Let me put it this way. So the providers on a claim, they are all on the claim FM. Now when we talk about provider directory, it is more about the provider FM standing alone.You have a service provider, service organization, service facility, and the affiliations associated with among all of these three organizations, and we also have network FM's. These FM's are independent standalone FM's, meaning that they do not.Necessarily have to interact with claim. The providers on a claim are all loaded into the claim on the claim item. Now if we need additional data, demographics about a provider or additional data about a provider, that is when we use the claim from the claim item.FM and then look up to the provider FM's, right? So if we want to do that kind of a lookup without mastering, I don't think it is feasible.+12*******42   17:13So you're saying that it's both you both have?So you have provider information in your claims data and provider information in a provider model of some kind, so they're duplicated information.Vallimala Palaneeappan   17:26The provider information on the claims data is very limited. Like you know you have the tins, the provider address, the provider speciality, things like that. But the provider model itself is very detailed, even more detailed.+12*******42   17:40Sure.Vallimala Palaneeappan   17:42You know, yeah, that's that's how it is. Yep.+12*******42   17:43That makes sense.It's just weird to put the yeah, OK, that's fine. I still don't really know what the FM are going to be used by us for.Rich Tallon - Contractor   17:51This.+12*******42   17:55What are what is Blue Cross of Idaho going to do with the foundation marks?Vallimala Palaneeappan   18:06OK, I would just take this back internally. First, let's I I wanna understand the scope and then come back on this topic Satish, if that's OK with everyone.+12*******42   18:16Sure.Sathish Dhanasekar   18:16That that's OK, but one question I want to ask Dan is does this director in if this directory data is including of all blue plans, is any of the provider BC data will be duplicated in this directory as well?+12*******42   18:28OK.Yeah.Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   18:37OK.+12*******42   18:37It has all plans in it, is my understanding. I haven't taken a close to this.Vallimala Palaneeappan   18:39Yeah, that could be duplication, that is.Sathish Dhanasekar   18:39Yeah, it it it has, it has all plans including including BCI. So we we could be duplicating our own providers then that begs question like OK then that would require a mastering that's what.So including this including BCX.Vallimala Palaneeappan   18:45Including DCI, yeah, yes.Sathish Dhanasekar   18:55Well, he's getting to.We are OK to iterate this out.+12*******42   18:58Doesn't require mastering, but they're at the same grain, right? The provider plan code and ID would be there that would link to the claim. So it's not like we need a master. They would just match. The keys would match.Rich Tallon - Contractor   19:06Correct.Right. And furthermore, right, so.Sathish Dhanasekar   19:15Mm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   19:15Yeah, the other the other good thing is, is the association does assign master IDs, so that will then they do kind of the mastering and matching. So if you have the same doctor for BCI and another plan, they would both share the same master ID from the association.Vallimala Palaneeappan   19:36Mm.OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   19:38It makes it makes your the job of mastering easier because there's already a master ID assigned.Vallimala Palaneeappan   19:45Mm-hmm. Interesting. OK, that's a good, um, information.Rich Tallon - Contractor   19:48For both the for the person, yeah, so they've got a person, you know, practitioner master ID, they've got a organization master ID and a location master ID.Vallimala Palaneeappan   19:51Uh huh.Thanks.OK.OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   20:02So this will help. So that that much that's gonna do.+12*******42   20:03Yeah, so I'm.Vallimala Palaneeappan   20:03OK. That's a good information. I can still, yeah, we can still take that back and then.+12*******42   20:06Yeah, this is Dan again.Sathish Dhanasekar   20:07Good.+12*******42   20:13Yeah, I just wanna understand.What the FM?Rich Tallon - Contractor   20:25OK.+12*******42   20:25Foundation marks for anything in the analytical side of the EDP, then it doesn't matter to me. But if if that's something I'm expected to to use in our data pipelines and our business rules, then I do care.Just trying to figure out where that fits in the scope of all the other stuff we're doing.Sathish Dhanasekar   20:49Have you had a chance to review our FM's? Uh, it's as anyone shared our FM generations to you. OK, but.+12*******42   20:49Does that make sense? So that's my question.I have not seen it, no.Sathish Dhanasekar   20:59OK, we we can send it over to you.+12*******42   21:02Perfect. That'd be great.Sathish Dhanasekar   21:04So this is our standard canonical model. So then just give you a brief overview right like just like how early explained like if you have a provider concept, the provider concept is right. So we have service provider, service provider, service location contract there is.+12*******42   21:09Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   21:20This our provider contract concept is a little expensive. We have each of FM models for each of those each of those concepts like contract, fee schedule, location, service facility and organization, operation, so on so. So what we do is like when you consume a provider data from a specific source we.Hydrate these particular FM. We populate these FM models and then this FM models will become a data point, a serving data point for a specific use case. Say for interop we build those application. All those data guides were provided data.Those will be feed off of from this formation model. So we consume from the run. We will standardize with the foundation model with our foundation model, all the provided data and then it goes off to a specific use case addresses. So in your analytical world if you're building any specific use case for.Of the provider data from the from the EDP platform you would have you would be building up your gold you particular use case from this foundation model data.Does it make sense or?+12*******42   22:36No, not from my point of view. No, it doesn't. I'll I'll look over that foundation Mart data. It doesn't make sense that I would use your pre aggregated data to inform to to use in my data pipelines.Sathish Dhanasekar   22:37You will be pretty.+12*******42   22:53Um, because I would have to rekey it and everything, so that seems awkward, but I'll review your document and see see if I have any other questions.Sathish Dhanasekar   23:02OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   23:08I I just just a note, I mean any other Blues plans that you do work for are also going to be interested in that same, you know, associate association directory information, right. So.This is not going to be a unique problem to us. I mean, every blue's going to share the same issue, right? How do you take the associations directory and consolidate that and use some of the elements to, you know?How do you, how do you deal with the national, the association directory, but have your own plan directory at the same time, right?So my question is, have you had this problem with other Blues?Sathish Dhanasekar   23:53Phone.So Ali, have we we have not interested any third party other blue plan providers before, right? No, so no.Vallimala Palaneeappan   24:01No, we have.Rich Tallon - Contractor   24:04Right. This is the first, yes. So no other blue and and the association directory is ingested by all the other plans, right? All the other blue plans. So I'm it's curious to.Vallimala Palaneeappan   24:16They might have it ingested in other systems, but not in Abacus.Rich Tallon - Contractor   24:22OK, got it.My only thing is like, if you tackled this, it wouldn't just be for us, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   24:42Oh yeah, so essentially like any any future scenarios, we will tackle it for this will accomplate as well, which. But then we we have to take a look at data that we have not done this before. Then we'll have to point out again, you're sending a master ID, master ID.Rich Tallon - Contractor   24:50Right.Sathish Dhanasekar   24:59All this information this would help. See the reason why we brought up master ID is because if if this particular directory has both BCA as well as other plans, now we also just in provided data from the BCA directly. Now if a claim in state claim comes in if that refers to.A particular TIN or based on the TIN and MPI goes the same provider then you would have two different provider record in the in the in the in the FM mods right. So then how do we reconserve that right that's that's where our.Rich Tallon - Contractor   25:32Yeah, you would always, you would always be operating on our plan code, right? So you'd say select for our plan code of, you know, 110 and if you didn't find it, then you could basically search across the whole directory. You could do things like that.Sathish Dhanasekar   25:47Yeah, the plan code that becomes a business key, right, for those particular provider record.Rich Tallon - Contractor   25:53Yep.Sathish Dhanasekar   25:57Um.Rich Tallon - Contractor   25:59I I mean, I I understand the problem. All I'm just saying is there's value for for you to consider tackling this beyond just, you know, BCI.Sathish Dhanasekar   26:03Right.Right, but but the if the directory BCA product directory would also have BCA provider, wouldn't that have the same bank code as the one you have it in the in our product directory?Rich Tallon - Contractor   26:22Well, we don't keep the plan code currently in our in our base directory files because it's just we just have our plan, right. So, so we haven't, we haven't merged all of the other Blue Cross plan directory into our, you know, internal directory if you will, right. So that's kind of.Sathish Dhanasekar   26:30OK.+12*******42   26:33OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   26:42Of the topic topic on the table, right? It's like do we treat this as one gigantic directory or or not?Vallimala Palaneeappan   26:58I lost that question. Satish, can you bring?Rich Tallon - Contractor   27:01Anyway, so sorry, I don't want to. No, I didn't mean to, you know, complicate it. I'm just making a play that or I'm making a point that, you know, this might be something you consider as a as a company, right? That's, you know, beyond the.Vallimala Palaneeappan   27:16Yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   27:17The the requirement of BCI.Vallimala Palaneeappan   27:17Yeah.Absolutely. Yeah. That is why we wanted to take it back internally, you know, have some discussion around it, discussion around it, yeah.Sachin, are you talking? Oh, you're writing? OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   28:02No, no, I'm just.OK, so we we will discuss internal leverage like see again you you want this to be added in a model which again our standards chronicle. We will have internal discussion see how we can approach this.Vallimala Palaneeappan   28:05Sure.Nilesh Trivedi   28:19So, so, so Satish Nilesh here, can you also go to the row #19? It is a simpler and I think that is also provided directly. Can you go to row #19?Sathish Dhanasekar   28:20And then we'll get back to you.Mhm.Yes.Oh, yes, this needs to be.Nilesh Trivedi   28:35So this this is also provided directory right? Just want my for my confirmation I just want.Kelly Good Clark   28:36That's that's not really. Yep. Yeah, this this is.Rich Tallon - Contractor   28:42Oh, this is a this is required for surfacing our our provider directory. So this has and and I think we talked about this before. This has the license information education.Sathish Dhanasekar   28:46So.Rich Tallon - Contractor   28:56Um, board certifications.Kelly Good Clark   29:02Accreditation.Rich Tallon - Contractor   29:02Yeah, it it's all of the accreditation which is required to surface that, right?Nilesh Trivedi   29:10Right, but this this has all the.Kelly Good Clark   29:12But is it? But Rich, it's local though, right? It's it's it's just our our local stuff, right? It's not out of state, is that correct? Yeah, this is just BCI information, so.Nilesh Trivedi   29:15Yep.Vallimala Palaneeappan   29:20Just a BCI.+12*******42   29:22Yeah, OK.+12*******58   29:23Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   29:26OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   29:27So we don't like facets has tables to, you know, put in like their internship and their education and their, you know, licenses and and specialty board certifications. But all those are going to be blank. All that's kept in simpler.Sathish Dhanasekar   29:48This is this is your internal BCA product product source of truth English for the other other village.Nilesh Trivedi   29:49I I have.Yeah, oh.Rich Tallon - Contractor   29:53Yeah, this is the source of truth for any any accreditations, if you will.Nilesh Trivedi   30:00Right. So I have a this just a question about business logic here that whatever in simpler provider directory, how exactly it is getting updated with the facet information you have with the providers means it's like In Sync with whatever you have been. Let's say that they have been providers who have been.Somebody has been left or somebody has been added. How exactly this is In Sync with the facets provider details which they have in the same from the simpler?Rich Tallon - Contractor   30:30Well, they're tied by NPI, right? So if you you, you might have a doctor in facets and you know we pull you know the location and where they work and a bunch of other attributes from facets, but we also then reach over to Simpler.Nilesh Trivedi   30:34Mhm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   30:47And pull, you know, again his license information out, out, you know, out from there and then we would match that with NPI. Now if we don't have a record, we don't have any license information or board certification, et cetera, right?Nilesh Trivedi   31:03Right.Sathish Dhanasekar   31:04So the the joint logic for this is so think of this like these credentialing information that accreditations all those two won't be in the facet. So we won't be ingesting from facet. This will come from simpler relation. So and we would have to say for not directly use cases, right?When we need the credentialing information, all those aggregation information for given provided directly, we would have to join based on the NPA key and that's what like if you look at the common in the 90 like simpler data would have about 20 different data tables like.And Rick already offered said that you provide the grain of the data. And then how do we link the process data to the simpler data to get the recommendations through MPI? OK, so yeah, you do a left join on the MPI.Nilesh Trivedi   31:50NBA.Sathish Dhanasekar   31:55Yeah, yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   31:56After after you form like so I basically have a bunch of queries that form it right preform it and NPI is the key of all that data that's attached to it and I do a left join with MPI.Nilesh Trivedi   31:57Yeah. Thank you.Thank you for the information.Sathish Dhanasekar   32:25All right.So if I think we will, so we will populate this FM, we will evaluate the possibilities which and we will go internally to have the discussion and see how we can.How we can affiliate that because again you said that it's there's a very business strong business case to have this in our foundation model and we will we will have a solution approach define how we manage this data internally and get back to you.Nilesh Trivedi   32:59OK, I mean.Sathish Dhanasekar   33:00And whatever models are we targeting to do we have the so this direct do we have any sample data is it with us like is it all the fire fire standard product directory guides that we are getting then we can we can use we can use it as a data to.Do the as a data dictionary to map.Rich Tallon - Contractor   33:20No, I mean, so I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to give you the queries to to join the data. So I mean, you don't need to go figure out the table structure because I've already done that, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   33:32OK, OK.And uh ERD.Rich Tallon - Contractor   33:48And Kelly, did we, I know we talked about, so did we get that that bucket copied over yet for them?Kelly Good Clark   34:00The simpler bucket. Um, Grant was working on it. I don't. I last I looked, I didn't see that it was being right, but I could have been looking in the wrong spot because I was. I was a little confused. I thought it had to be done at the bucket level, but he could do it at the partition.Rich Tallon - Contractor   34:00Yeah.Kelly Good Clark   34:16I didn't see anything yesterday. I don't know if he is he in the meeting today. I don't know if he's here. He's here letting me talk. No, it's it's not. It's not copied yet. I can probably get that done today. I got a little bit.Grant Ballard   34:22Yeah, I'm here. Um.Rich Tallon - Contractor   34:26Sorry, I should've asked you.Grant Ballard   34:34Slipped my mind because we don't have any tracking on it, so we just have a teams message and that scrolled off my my screen. So yeah, I'll I'll work on that today.Rich Tallon - Contractor   34:48OK, cool.Kelly Good Clark   34:49Yeah, I think there's a Jared ticket, but it was originally in Rod's name and I pushed it to your name yesterday. But yeah, we can talk about that later, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   35:11So this is not historical, this entirety of product data.Rich Tallon - Contractor   35:18Yeah, there's no historical requirement around it. It's just as it looks right now.Sathish Dhanasekar   35:22Yeah, it's it just says right now it's an incremental. Yeah, see if the new product data comes in.The.So is it? So how is the data that we're getting? Like is it the same five standard JSON we are getting or is it the standard that?Rich Tallon - Contractor   35:44No, it's just gonna be, it's just it's gonna be delimited tables. So and then then I'll give you the sequel to basically form it.Sathish Dhanasekar   36:00OK.What else do I think we've covered?OK.All right, let's go to the CMSLS long term care source.Give us the context. What is this source about?And what do we use it for like?Is that a specific business case that any data points that we're looking from the analytical perspective that?Do you have the right, right, right person on this call to clarify this source for us?Kelly Good Clark   36:48Yeah, this is, and I don't know if this is really just another something that's stored in facets that's related to CMS or if this is something we're being pulled is being pulled down. And I think it's a good question. It's like, what is the context of this? Who asked for this? Kind of like the the chicken crosswalk.Um um.I guess, do we know where this came from? Because I I thought this was stuff. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, Dan, or any other passive person. This is, I think this is just, it's just sort of, is it not?Sathish Dhanasekar   37:37Road was silent.Kelly Good Clark   37:39Yeah, yeah. Like I said, I I I don't think Dan, do you know if this CMS long-term care stuff is that pulled down from CMS or is that just stuff that's already stored in facets? I I don't know who is asking for this.I suspect it was a lot. I mean, this would be a Tamara Hess question as well. You know, if anything, she could point us in the right direction. And she might even know the data, like, is this just stuff that we pulled down or is this stuff that we just pull out of facets?Um.+12*******42   38:18Yeah, I don't know the answer to that either, Kelly.I don't know of anything in facets that's specifically low income subsidy, long term care, but.And I'm not familiar with any analytics we have on that around that, but there's a lot of stuff in government programs that they they do it themselves. So I'm not sure that would be a good camera question.Kelly Good Clark   38:37I remember.I I know something.Yeah, I I know I've worked on the list before, like five years ago, but I I thought it was we were pulling it from facets, but I'll I'll have to let me let me find out.+12*******42   38:49OK.Kelly Good Clark   39:05I remember the person I worked with, so I can reach out to that person. But yeah, this again, CMS stuff that's going to be along the lines of Tamra, although some of the stuff we can kind of pull out.Sathish Dhanasekar   39:44This is.Chiva constraint extracts. We're getting the final one. The next the next sources we have been access like Chiva constraint extracts and and the provider of registration billing entities. So let's talk about this Chiva constraint extracts.So we the way we understood this is mostly going to be the.We have one minute. I had a note to that.Oh.Is this Kelly? Is this a provider authorization extract or something?That we are loading on the external entity.Kelly Good Clark   40:43What? What line are you on? Are you online? Are you on the jeeb? Okay, so okay, so Giva. Yeah. So So right now we are replicating Giva file to you guys from our previous style, but they never got ingested.Sathish Dhanasekar   40:45So this is on the line 39. Sorry, this is on the line 39.Kelly Good Clark   41:01We are in the middle of a GEVA upgrade right now to GEVA 66, and that goes live in January of 2026. So what I suspect is at that point in time, we would just doSathish Dhanasekar   41:03OK.Kelly Good Clark   41:14a full load there. I'm I'm assuming there's no point in trying to get it done by the end of the year. I'm not sure when when I'd have to see the the thing to know when you guys plan on doing whatever. But my assumption is we would be go ahead. Sorry.Sathish Dhanasekar   41:25Yeah, see.No, no, sorry. Go ahead. You you finish your thought. Sorry, go ahead.Kelly Good Clark   41:33So yeah, so I I believe, and this is where we'll we'll probably, we've got a G the team, and we would probably work with them to help get that information, you know, some of that basic information, the mapping of the files.Sathish Dhanasekar   41:45Hm.OK. Hmm.Kelly Good Clark   41:53had it in the past, but it'll be new. So they'll get you the new mappings and the new files, I'm assuming, and then then go from there. I think it was mid-January that we're going live. So I I don't know howSathish Dhanasekar   42:05OK.So you don't think it's now worth it to just now because of the earlier version of the extract, it's something. So you'd prefer to go with the newer version of the extract?Kelly Good Clark   42:10how much we can reallyI mean I don't know if you had I mean I mean we're in October now and if we're going live in January with six six and I believe it's a pretty big upgrade we haven't upgraded we're kind of behind on upgrades right now because we had a a different upgradeSathish Dhanasekar   42:35Mhm.Kelly Good Clark   42:37going on, and so everything else kind of went to the wayside. And so Jeeva is now getting upgraded currently, will go live in January of 2026. So I guess, and again, I don't know what the cell looks like, but I'm assuming if Jeeva isthe 2026 deliverable, we would probably want to just start with the G the 66, which will be available in mid-January. Anyone can correct me, but it just seems it's going to. It's not going to be a small list, I I don't think.I I could be wrong, but um.Dale Fryer   43:21Maybe if we just have a a meeting with the Jeeva team, Satish, maybe we can walk through this and get their recommendations on where they are and what would be the best solution for this.Kelly Good Clark   43:25Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   43:34OK, but this is this is more of an authorizations right? The data set from Jeeva.I'm just trying to get the the the the operational part I get like say whether we go live with the current version of Jiwa extracts or data data set, are we are we going with the newer version? That's definitely we can take the call whether we can scope this into 2026.Or 2025, but I'm just trying to get the context of the data area that in this particular extract will be. I'm assuming this is related to authorization data set.So something that we can provide that.Rich Tallon - Contractor   44:19Are you talking about line 40?Sathish Dhanasekar   44:22Yeah, line 39. Sorry.Rich Tallon - Contractor   44:24OK.+12*******42   44:25Yeah, 39 is is authorizations and clinical program tracking.Sathish Dhanasekar   44:26You were extracted.OK. Both are the decision and clinical program tracking, OK.So when you mean clinical program tracking, can you give me an example then like?+12*******42   44:45Sure. Yeah, we have a smoking cessation program that company like our large groups can opt into, they can buy up, they can add that to their benefits and if they do, then their members are are eligible to participate in a smoking cessation program and we track their.milestones as they go through that program. We do the same thing with we have like a weight loss program, diabetes prevention program, andThings like that, some musculoskeletal stuff and we track all those programs and the as the members move through them so that all that data comes from all the detailed data for that comes from Chiva.Does that make sense?Sathish Dhanasekar   45:36Yes.+12*******42   45:38So they have encounters as part of those programs that are not necessarily claims. They're they're encounters, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   45:39But the.It's just more of a reporting on those program data set, OK.+12*******42   45:48Sometimes there's claims, but not always, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   45:50It's OK, but didn't we discuss something similar that also done through retro charter yesterday? No.+12*******42   45:56Yeah, so the group, the group eligibility that goes with those programs comes from Salesforce. So, So there's a Salesforce component that's at the group level where they buy into these programs and they become eligible for those programs. And then in JEVA is where all the details are tracked of the interactions happening.Sathish Dhanasekar   46:02Oh, the Salesforce. OK, OK. Oh.OK.+12*******42   46:16Between the members and providers and the response from members on outreach programs and stuff like that. So a lot of times we will send them a a mail or a brochure about the program when they are eligible and or sometimes do phone outreach if they have diagnosis to qualify them for the.Sathish Dhanasekar   46:32Oh, yes, this is, yes.+12*******42   46:35The program like if they are pre-diabetic, then we might reach out one-on-one by phone or something to try and engage them in the program. So anyway, it sort of varies, but but that all that stuff, that interaction between the members and us and the providers gets tracked in Geva.2.Rich Tallon - Contractor   46:59So what would happen is you would get conditions and observations as they go through and achieve milestones or they get checkups or so you you get the fact that they are, they might be.+12*******42   47:09Right.Rich Tallon - Contractor   47:14Obese, right? And then you might get weight measurements if they're, you know, in a weight loss program, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   47:16Mhm.Mhm.No, no, I I get those, those outreach programs, right that that contributes to your overall health, health. It is how what we're offering and then you get into the plan discounts. OK. So yes, I remember we discussed this and I OK, that's wonderful.+12*******42   47:23OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   47:40Program planning data set and we are we will.So.So.+12*******42   48:08OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   48:16Meet with the distributing to.Rich Tallon - Contractor   48:25Yes.Sathish Dhanasekar   48:38Oh.OK, that's correct. Yeah, now. So the is there any?So if if I'm consuming the Salesforce data in the bronze, again we're gonna keep it in the bronze. So I'm assuming these milestones will also be this program tracking milestones will also be kept in the bronze.And then you you you would have a way to link between this milestones data, critical program tracking between the sales for data as well, correct?Then.+12*******42   49:28Sorry, I missed that. Can you repeat the question?Kelly Good Clark   49:29I'm sorry, could you repeat?Sathish Dhanasekar   49:33So, so this we are consuming the Salesforce data and all this program data set from these three items would be in the bronze and I'm also assuming that those clinical data tracking data that we go on interest will also stay in the bronze as well.And then you would have a way to link between these two data sets to do drive analytics.+12*******42   49:53Yeah, we we have processes, we have business rules that link them together.Sathish Dhanasekar   50:00OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   50:02Now you would surface, you would surface the clinical information though in the fire end point, right that are that are adjusted through the G of information has clinical information that would then go to the fire end point, is that correct?Sathish Dhanasekar   50:18Yes, that's 40057.OK, so.+12*******42   50:25So what was the comment about not ingesting it after the bronze layer?Is it just the program eligibility stuff?Sathish Dhanasekar   50:34Yeah, we'll have to look at the data.+12*******42   50:34So that might not be needed, but the clinical encounters would be needed.Rich Tallon - Contractor   50:40Right that I'm just trying to get. I'm just trying to confirm that the Giva data makes it past bronze into gold and into the Onyx layer.+12*******42   50:48OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   50:56Um.OK, so if there is a clinical data set comes in through these as well, not just the program details, we will have to look at the data set, understand the dictionary. Is there anyone can can we get a data dictionary of those data sets that we receive in this?To do extract.+12*******42   51:19We haven't been able to get one from the company that produces Jeeva, but maybe we can't. We should try that again.Kelly Good Clark   51:26I think that, I was going to say, I think we did have a a GEVA data dictionary we sent earlier, but we're going to need a new data dictionary for the the newest set. I think this is where we just need to work with the, and GEVA, the people, what is that company?Sathish Dhanasekar   51:26Yeah, then we would know.Kelly Good Clark   51:46They're hard to work with, but they charge for everything. But But yeah, we will have to get the latest one for this. What's that?+12*******42   51:46OK.The Omega.I think it's the Omega, is that right?I think it's the Omega. Isn't that the name of the company?Rich Tallon - Contractor   52:00Yeah, that's it.Kelly Good Clark   52:00Yeah, yeah, the Omega. Yeah, yeah. But um, we did have one.+12*******42   52:02Yeah, they don't like us.Kelly Good Clark   52:06Yeah, it was. It was really hard to read. But I yeah, we'll get another one for the latest version. We'll um, I think maybe um work with Dale and and get something set up with the G folks. And um, and like I said, I've got one for the the prior stuff, and I think we've already sent it to you guys.+12*******42   52:11We.Kelly Good Clark   52:24Then I think we can get a second one for the latest, I'm assuming.Sathish Dhanasekar   52:29Yeah, so if you're well, I I think we it would make sense, right Kelly? Because if you are upgrading our at any point in time, definitely we will need that upgraded the new version of data dictionary if you are, if you have not interested.+12*******42   52:42OK.OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   52:44Then again it it points all make sense because we don't need a clinical data until 0057 that is for next year and if you're already in the middle of a migration that goes to a newer version.We might as well go with the newer version and start with start the ingestion with the newer version and new data dictionary and it would make a lot more sense than just working with instead of just consuming the older version of data set.Kelly Good Clark   52:59Right.Sathish Dhanasekar   53:14So.Nilesh Trivedi   53:15So, so Satish, to add this or the Jeeva, if it is it has the care plan details and the care team details, then yes, for the clinical 0057 it does require that that details.Sathish Dhanasekar   53:27Yes. So that that that's what I'm saying like we do need the data dictionary part Nilesh like to identify which part of that is data set is will be used for the care plan on and plan activity and then.If we do get that right from that, then we would need that 40057 but not 915.Rich Tallon - Contractor   53:49Well, hang on. So 99115 has is currently saying if you have conditions or other clinical information, you we're supposed to surface it now, right? Viva is the place where that information exists.Nilesh Trivedi   53:50Right.Sathish Dhanasekar   54:03OK.But I I thought that was clinical EPA was not in scope for this year, but we are not.Nilesh Trivedi   54:14Yes, yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   54:14OK. All right. That's that's fine. What I'm saying. Well, what I'm saying is though like technically we we are, we are supposed to be servicing that data currently, right. So we're quote in violation. So yeah, we can put it off, but it's like.Nilesh Trivedi   54:27Yeah, yes.Rich Tallon - Contractor   54:33You know, we we are out of compliance technically.Kelly Good Clark   54:37So, Rich, how are we? Are we on it? How can we be out of compliance with Abacus when we're not live with them yet? I guess I guess I'm trying to hear what you're saying.Sathish Dhanasekar   54:39True.Rich Tallon - Contractor   54:48No, no, no. But what I'm what, what what I'm saying is BCI is out of compliance because technically we should be surfacing the information we have in Geva right now today and we don't.O.Kelly Good Clark   55:02I think we are. When you're saying we're out of compliance, are you saying that the people on-prem currently are not using it?Rich Tallon - Contractor   55:11No. So by CMS, the current CMS regulation say any any clinical data that you currently have in a system should be available to members on the fire endpoint.We have clinical information, so we have like observations and conditions that are in Geva right right now and we do not, we do not harvest that and then convert it and surface it in our current fire endpoint.Kelly Good Clark   55:38Right.Rich Tallon - Contractor   55:45So all I'm saying is if you're saying that it's not part of the the current, the current mandate, well, that's not technically correct, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   55:53No, no, it's part of the current mandate, but it's not within the scope of 2025 implement.Rich Tallon - Contractor   56:00OK, that that's cool. I I I just, I just wanted to put that out there.Sathish Dhanasekar   56:02But if that's something need to be changed that we we can definitely get developed then that we need to look into the Joe and the other conversations need to happen to.Rich Tallon - Contractor   56:07No.I'm not saying I want to have a whole, you know, discussion on scope and timing. I'm just like.I I just want to make sure that people understand that it's like we are, it's not something that is part of the new regulations, it's part of the current regulations, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   56:32OK, that one. Yeah, that's perfectly valid.So this I'm I'm just capturing a detail of Rick. So this will go into the G was going to provide observations of spec conditions and conditions I believe as well.Rich Tallon - Contractor   56:58Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   57:01Conditions. Anything else I'm missing here?On the on the topic level like.Rich Tallon - Contractor   57:11No, I think that captures it. I mean, there's probably other resources that can be derived from that, but I think that's not detail that we need to explore right now.Sathish Dhanasekar   57:19So wouldn't we also have the goal?Comes part of this or do we not track the goal?Rich Tallon - Contractor   57:25Yeah, I I I couldn't. I'm not an expert in Jiva and what the contexts are, so I I'm not gonna be able to answer that those kind of questions, but I would, I would assume that you're the goal would be in there, right? But I can't confirm that.Sathish Dhanasekar   57:33OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   57:43OK.Nilesh Trivedi   57:46And your team like your team name, your team status it it is there.Rich Tallon - Contractor   57:49Yeah, exactly.Uh, yes, the care team would be there because.Nilesh Trivedi   57:57Yeah, so you can add the security.Sathish Dhanasekar   58:07And what's the other one? Dinesh, this.Nilesh Trivedi   58:10No, no care team. No, it's just under care team you have. You will get the name, status and everything just to care team.Sathish Dhanasekar   58:17OK.In your direction.All right, getting close. Final one. Anything else you wanna we're missing here or I think our rest of the conversation whether when we're gonna implement or which version is that's a different conversation. But anything else that we need to capture as part of this?Anything else we're missing? If not, I can move to the next source.Nilesh Trivedi   59:01Nothing, Satish. I think only the means. I'm not sure whether you're asking about the any source, but yesterday we asked about the EMR or clinical. So I think maybe we can. OK. OK. Yeah. OK. You can continue. Thank you.Sathish Dhanasekar   59:02Oh.We will come to that, yes.Come on.OK, so the next one is the.Provide a web registration on building entities.So we so this is something we have not worked before so context on this would help. So is anybody we have a right person here to for a context.Rich Tallon - Contractor   59:46Yeah, I can. I can speak with them.Sathish Dhanasekar   59:49Yep.Rich Tallon - Contractor   59:51OK, So what what this is is when a provider group wants access to to the provider portal, they register.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:01Oh, registration.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:00:04So they they register on the provider portal. The important elements of this is one of the most important elements is like who is the administrative contact, you know, for a particular group.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:41Mm.Hmm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:00:41That request goes to the administrative contact that is in this database.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:50OK, this is for your EDP use case, so.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:00:55But it's also like because I know that there's going to be if there's any involvement in Abacus and provider directory validation, you'll you'll need this data.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:00:57OK.How how would can you can you give me an example where it's like how would we so this is more go ahead.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:01:12Well.Well, OK, so yes, so sorry. So you won't be doing any directory validation, but anybody that does has to has to have this piece of data. So it's it's it's an important element.So if we have to.Kelly Good Clark   1:01:29Where is this data, Rich? Like, like how would we get this data to them?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:01:32Uh, it is.It's it's currently in an on-prem SQL custom built table set, so it's like prod 57 or something.Kelly Good Clark   1:01:44Could you send that? OK, could you send that information to me and I'll shore it up and and figure out how we're going to get it to them?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:01:47Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, the provider team has had some effort to try to move this into into a WS, but I don't believe that that's completed. So I currently have to pull it out of a table set that's on Prem and I'll send you the, I'll send you the info.And the billing entities are.Are entities that might do billing for across several different provider groups, right? So and those relationships are in this database. So there might be, you know, billing, you know, billing entity XYZ.And they might bill for, you know, 20 or 30 different provider provider groups.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:02:45But they will register as an organization also in the provider portal, correct? Like so the hierarchy would be you, yes, you would have individual providers registering and then they would have organization application within within the portal that you would use their.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:02:50Yeah.Right, correct.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:03:03Tin and inauguration affiliation inside the inside that portal to affiliate them to a particular organization group. At that point on that portal any so the provider can either submit as any claims or authorization as a provider or to a building entry.+12*******42   1:03:12Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:03:22And they would have two different kind of a registration, one for on their own, one for the organization they operate with, correct?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:03:30Yeah, that's correct.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:03:32OK.Uh.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:03:34So if you're if you're gonna send any kind of contact out right for provider groups, you have to you have to send it through this administrative contact as well.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:03:39Mhm.OK, so say if we get this data extra, we figure it out, we get this this registration information here. How would we? I'm trying to just to clarify my understanding or to curious.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:03:52OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:04:02How this would help in terms of directory and provider references? We give me a business one specific use case for me to make sense of it. Like I understand there's a registration data we it has an admin over the organization or contacts like.From organization administrative perspective, what are the providers registered in the provider portal and would be submitting any kind of authorization or claims through the portal? I get that, but how would we relate to?In a larger context with that, where do we link this data? We need that.+12*******42   1:04:36OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:04:41Yeah, that that's a good question because.I off off the top of my head. I don't know where it fits in the in the overall, you know, if you're thinking about a firebase model.What I've done is I've on the organization, I've I've put an administrative contact extension in the organization resource, but you know that's that's not, you know that's a custom extension.So.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:05:18So would it? So does it make sense if I say OK, we consume this data, we park it in the bronze raw addition layer and then we would because I.We we we can evaluate the data dictionary. Give me one minute.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:05:38Yeah, it's a good, it's a it's a good question. Like, you know, does it really, does it really need to go through the abacus layers, right? Or is this something that just makes its way into EDP directly?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:05:402.Mm-hmm.Yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:05:50Because I I like right now I can't think of a use case or so you don't need to surface this in the fire end point. I mean there is an administrative contact section in and again the organization resource, but it's not really required for the directory.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:05:58Mhm.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:06:10Um.So yeah, and again, I I don't know who made, you know, who who put this request on. I'm just giving you the background of what it is, but there could be an argument. Go ahead.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:21Mhm.+12*******42   1:06:22Yeah, it is something that we would need. Yeah, we we would need that on the ADP side.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:23OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:06:29OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:30So, so.+12*******42   1:06:30So we would want it to be at least in the bronze wear.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:33Oh that that's that's perfectly fine. We can put it in there. So Dan. So if I say OK we will just this data put it in the bronze and then you that that because we don't have to I did the foundation model because this is mostly mostly like.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:06:34OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:06:51Registration information. Then you can use any specific use cases. You can directly get this data from the join from the bronze layer to get it.+12*******42   1:06:55Yeah.Yeah, for web registration, that's fine. For the owner owning entities, that hierarchy of provider facilities and groups that roll up to a bigger ownership like a health system or something.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:07:08Mhm.+12*******42   1:07:16That would also be needed too, but seems like you might want that hierarchy in the foundation Mart as well for provider.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:07:23But wouldn't that already you would get that from these other fast database through organization operation?+12*******42   1:07:29No, because we have, we'll have like a large hospital system that'll own a bunch of clinics or they'll buy a chain of clinics. And sometimes those clinics stay under a different tax ID number. So like we have a hospital system.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:07:31I guess.+12*******42   1:07:46Called Saint Luke's in Idaho. The last time I looked at had 11 or 12 different tins and the TIN level is what the provider group slash facility is at, but there's ownership above that level that changes. Does that make sense?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:07:48Mhm.+12*******42   1:08:03OK.So there's systems or or groups that own multiple multiple of these provider groups or facilities.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:08:14But they operate in a different they yeah, so they operate in a different thing.+12*******42   1:08:14And so there's kind of a ownership hierarchy, but but they do business as.Yep, different different tax ID numbers.Owned by a hospital system or something like that. So there will be 10 or 15 tax ID numbers that are all part of that same hospital system.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:08:29Oh, strange.OK, that's strange because usually the tax ID, the billing entity pair usually goes to yeah.+12*******42   1:08:39They they slowly.They they usually they slowly resolve over time, but when the hospital system first purchases something, or maybe they've run them as a separate subsidiary or something like that, but they're still owned by a bigger organization and we contract with the bigger organization.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:08:51Oh, it's it's oh.OK. So the contracting rate is as soon as they acquire it, even though they operate on different tax ID, you still want to apply that bigger group contracting rate with this clinical, OK, until they.+12*******42   1:09:08Yeah. We still want to cover that in our contracting efforts with the provider when we when we go to them for a contract. Yeah. So anyway, it's always a little bit in flux, but we do use that for analytics.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:09:15Until they get robe into the. Makes sense.+12*******42   1:09:23I don't know how that would apply to your foundation mark.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:09:24Yeah. And it's actually pretty important, right. And and this can go in the organization, you know, the part of can gives you that ability to do the hierarchy of the organizations. So it it's it's also there's also a requirement to have this hierarchy.+12*******42   1:09:29Oh.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:09:43When when requesting clinical information because the clinical information contact is typically at you know that higher level and it and it's really difficult to figure out you know where to go to say you know even the fax line that you need to request the medical records from.So I you know from that perspective if this is where we, you know this is where we can source that hierarchy information from it's it's pretty important on there.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:10:31OK.Yeah, we I don't think we have a target foundational mod for this.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:10:41We can go in the organization.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:10:47So it could, but then we could use this too. I'm thinking so from the facets we would get this provided about us under a different organization operation, but the provider building registration would provide that context.It.To upload it again then, which means that we're changing the see that's that's my challenge. So I.So there is one source from facets telling me, hey, this provider is not really operated with this group, right? Because the other constraint that Dan was saying, but this provider and building registration truly tells me, OK, this ex provider is truly operated with this organization.Because that's more real.+12*******42   1:11:36No, it's more like a hierarchy. So in facets, there are practitioners, provider types and facility provider types and group provider types. So practitioners usually have a relationship with a facility or a group.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:11:45Mhm.+12*******42   1:11:53And then that facility, a collection of facilities or groups has entries in this billing entity.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:11:54Mhm.+12*******42   1:12:04Relationship that rolls them up even further. So you could see them as a three-layer hierarchy. Does that make sense? So a practitioner, clinic and owning entity, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:12:15No, it it just makes sense. That's why we have we.+12*******42   1:12:20So it's not all all over the place. Each practitioner's relationship with a with a facility or group is unique. So a practitioner level provider ID doesn't doesn't belong to more than one provider group or clinic.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:12:28No.+12*******42   1:12:35They would get a new provider ID if that happens.So they can be the same provider but have multiple records and facets because of their that describe their relationship with.Provider groups and facilities.And those groups and facilities might be owned by a by a larger company and that's what this billing entity table tracks.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:13:01So in the in the organization resource, there's a part of, right. So you can basically, you know, point at another organization and say this organization is part of this other organization and then you can basically designate a type as a hospital system.Right, etcetera. So that's how you can build your hierarchy just with organization and then you can use the organization affiliation record to basically affiliate people to those different levels.Right.Does that make sense? And I'm not sure how you handle hospital systems today.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:13:39No.We we have a facility service facility location that we service location to link it right. So my my current rum is coming coming from OK to Dan's point if.If we have that application, say both with the group as well as the facility, hospital facility location and practitioner goes through a facility or to a group, right, medical group or to a particular facility, right. And then if we have that hierarchy in the facets, we're getting that information already.And if that information up to date, the providers who's registering from through the portal would also have the same hierarchal link billing entity, correct?So the practitioner would have a billing. In that case a billing would be going to the hospital or to the group, correct from the from the billing entity level.If I if I'm just looking for the passage data itself.+12*******42   1:14:43Yeah.If you're just, well, FAFSA data doesn't have the billing entity, but if you're just talking about the billing provider on the claim, yeah, that would just point at the group or facility.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:14:49Right.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:14:49That's true.Yes, yes. So if a if a practitioner submits, if a provider affiliates to a hospital or a group and then they submit a claim through the patient comes through that particular facility or group, the building tax ID would be.+12*******42   1:14:56Yes.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:15:10That particular facility or the group right and the same that the provider say now take the one step down. If a provider is registered in the provider portal and if they're submitting that claim from the provider portal, you will be registered with that billing entity so that the any payment comes through.+12*******42   1:15:14Correct.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:15:29That portal through that to our claim system would automatic application to that building entity and again this in this case the source of truth is still going to be the facet system, correct?+12*******42   1:15:40Yeah, for for exchanging money, for sure, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:15:44For money, right? So.+12*******42   1:15:45That has to go to the right tin here. Yeah, the money has to go to the right tin. So that's always going to be at the facility or clinic level or the individual practitioner if they have a private practice. And so the ownership, the billing entity that we're talking about, the ownership entity.Doesn't have to do with where the money goes. It has to do with how we report on them and how we contract them. Does that make sense?So if we go contract with St. Luke's Hospital System, they have five or six physical hospitals and a bunch of clinics and some and some doc in the box places. Those there are several tax ID numbers.inside of that organization. And when we go to them to do our contracting, we want to do our contracting for all of those pins with one negotiation, right? So So they will frequently be under the sameSathish Dhanasekar   1:16:311.+12*******42   1:16:43Uh.Similar agreement anyway. So for analytics, it's really important for us to group things that way. I I don't think it's important for us to group things that way for billing, for like cutting checks back and forth and so on.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:16:46OK.OK, so then how will this? OK, so then.+12*******42   1:17:00I think that all happens at the FAFSA. FAFSA has all the information for for cutting checks to providers. That all happens inside. Well, all the information is there for billing.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:17:16But wouldn't you already also the facets need to have that contracting information also in the facets for each of those groups, the fee schedule, so that separate fee schedule?+12*******42   1:17:26Correct. Yep. Each of them would have a separate. Each of them could have a separate agreement. Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:17:31Yes, separate pricing contract and the fee schedule, right, based on which you the adjudication.+12*******42   1:17:34Yep. Yeah, it just may be done at the same time. But those contracts might be might be signed by the same group of people, if that makes sense.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:17:43Same group of people. Yes, now, now, now I'm OK, let's now layer down this to this building. So consuming. So I'm sorry. So when I when provider registered.+12*******42   1:17:47I.So it's important for analytics. I don't know if it's important for for surfacing with the fire data.Rich said that there's a place for it. Is that what you said, Rich, is in the organization?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:18:06Well, there is, but what I'm saying is it's not important for the servicing the directory information, right?+12*******42   1:18:15Yeah, right.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:18:15Like it's not a requirement to have the administrative contact as part of, you know, part of that organization record. Yeah, we've added it. We did not. It's not required.+12*******42   1:18:25Corrected.Yeah, it's more about our relationship with them as a business entity.Between Blue Cross of Idaho and or provider organization of some kind, it's less about cutting checks or moving money back and forth, or even really reporting on who who owns a claim. We do have some.Accountable care organization kind of arrangements with people that rely with hospital systems and so on that rely on this higher level grouping. But other than that, so I don't know if we're.In our interop agreement, are we sending attributed membership back and forth to our provider partners or is that going to stay in house?Does anybody know?If that's in the scope of this.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:19:20Number 2.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:19:21I I don't know so.+12*******42   1:19:23I haven't heard. I haven't heard that that would that our interop agreement would include that, but.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:19:31Right.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:19:33Hey, Nilesh, can you chime in like, can you come up with the question done again?+12*******42   1:19:40Yeah. So we have, we have agreements with these hospital systems and so on that include attributing members to them and having a per capita sort of element to the contract, so per member.Nilesh Trivedi   1:19:40Oh, mm-hmm.+12*******42   1:19:57Charge in exchange for reduced rates or cost sharing arrangement or something like that. And so for those interchanges with our with those health systems, we do use this billing entity to roll to attribute members to their providers based on the care that they're.getting and say, okay, this member is your responsibility. We're going to now pay you so many dollars per month for this member and you're going to give us this reduced rate that we've agreed on in exchange. So we have those kind of data feeds going back and forth. We send them eligibility and membership information.On the members that they're accountable for.Does that all make sense? So, so there's that, there's that data exchange between us and these health systems. We're sending information back and forth at that level. I don't, I haven't heard that that's part of our interop agreement with you guys, but I don't know.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:20:42You're talking about a capitation agreement between a provider.Nilesh Trivedi   1:20:57I think we have to check with the SOW back Satish to go with this if we have or not.+12*******42   1:20:57That kind of data exchange.Yeah, if that's beyond the SOW, then we don't have to agree with it.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:21:12Yeah, well, member attribution to a particular provider networker doesn't require part of main problem mandate. That is where my question comes from.Nilesh Trivedi   1:21:21We do require.+12*******42   1:21:22Yeah, yeah. So we are going to, my understanding is you are, we are going to send you attributed member attributed membership provider attributions to fold into your data. But at least that's what I was told a few months ago is that.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:21:36So provider attribution is required.+12*******42   1:21:37Our PCP execution process, you're going to consume that. What's that?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:21:42I believe provided the applications required for probably for the interrupt scenario, right Nilesh?+12*******42   1:21:50Yeah.Nilesh Trivedi   1:21:51So in that in so as I said that in the I think you already noted out that in the provider attribution we do require the organization practitioner location practitioner role. I think we are getting it from the data, sorry provider directory.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:22:08So the question is, do we?+12*******42   1:22:08Yeah, and that and that's fine. If we need to, if you need to do the actual data sends, then you might need the entity information. That's what I'm saying.Nilesh Trivedi   1:22:18So so for the for the ADP, I think in broader scope might be you have you might have to add that details, but from the interrupt perspective these are the details which we have to only consider.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:22:31So we we don't need a member attribution, we only need a provider attribution.Nilesh Trivedi   1:22:36Or provider directory, yeah.+12*******42   1:22:37Well, that's the same thing. That's the same thing.The members are attributed to a provider.in our provider attribution.So it's a relationship between the member and the provider.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:22:51And the provider.+12*******42   1:22:54It's a new relationship between the member and provider based on an attribution algorithm rather than on an assignment of a PCP or something like that.So my understanding was that was part of the data that you needed that we needed to provide over the next few months with our.Are shared to you guys.That you need the PCP attribution information.What I'm saying is if the PCP attribution information is for sending data feeds to our health systems, then you might also need the entity information.But I don't know if that's one of the data feeds or if they just wanted you to have it for for analytical purposes or something.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:23:40Yeah. But see the member relationship to a provider, I don't think it is part of the public requirement, Dan. That's what I'm saying is see when when we see the provider attribution, right, it's a provider relationship between the hospital, yeah, yeah.+12*******42   1:23:48OK, no, that's just different from what I was.Yeah, it's different from what I was told because I was told a couple of months ago that I needed to put that on our road map so that I could send so that we could send provider attribution to you.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:24:05Well, the member, the member's PCP is required on the fire end point.+12*******42   1:24:10Well, the the assigned PCP is in facets.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:24:15OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:24:15Right that that will be part of our member model.+12*******42   1:24:15But this is this is not the assigned PCP. This is an attributed PCP that's based on their claims history with a provider to to decide who is their primary care physician in practice, rather than on paper.Because most of our membership doesn't isn't required to have a PCP named, right? But we still want to associate them with a provider who is accountable for their for most of their care. And so we have an algorithm that does that. And my understanding was that you that Abacus needed that information from us.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:24:35Right.Well, wouldn't you create a care team record based on that information that this PCP is part of the care team for this member?+12*******42   1:24:58Hello.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:25:09Even though it might not be the official quote PCP.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:09Love to.+12*******42   1:25:10I.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:13So the official PCP assigned to the member will be part of our member record. Sorry, sorry to cut you off. Yeah, this is you're saying this is more than that, like say the group of PCPS within the same network.Kelly Good Clark   1:25:16I I don't know what you're asking, Rich.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:25:20Right. I get that, I think.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:28Attributed to the member, is that what you're saying or is it the last PCPS that that he has done in the past?+12*******42   1:25:30But.No, what I'm saying is we have a named PCP relationship for plans. Some plans require a PCP. You have to you have to name your PCP right for a plan. So some of some of our membership has that relationship already defined.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:37Mhm.Yes, it's a mouse.+12*******42   1:25:48With that named PCP, but most of our membership doesn't. Most of our membership, it doesn't. Most of our plans don't require a PCP and so the member doesn't have one recorded in the system. So we have a a process after facets.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:25:49Mhm.Mhm.+12*******42   1:26:05It goes through their claims records and attributes them to the provider month by month based on who their care has been mostly with recently, and there's a bunch of variables that go into that.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:26:18Oh, it's part of the care. OK, specific care. OK, it's.+12*******42   1:26:20So this is about, this is about which provider is actually caring for the member primarily and we use that information in our per capita agreements with health systems. Whether you're not doing that sends and maybe it's not important. I was just told that you needed the PCP attribution information.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:26:27Primarily for.+12*******42   1:26:38From that process, I'm not sure what exactly you needed it for, but I was told to put that on the road map for stuff that we are sharing to you guys.From our from our Snowflake instance.Because we'll have a share going both directions, right? You're going to have a share for us and we're going to have a share for you is my understanding.For post processing kind of stuff, stuff that doesn't exist in our on Prem systems but does in the Snowflake cloud environment.Like PCP attribution.Or.I mean, it exists on Prem, but we're moving that process to the cloud, so at some point it won't.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:27:35So this is part of the specific care package. So remember going for a specific care service, then you assign a particular speciality group of doctors for that.+12*******42   1:27:45But if you're going to base the care team just on every provider that they've had a claim with for the past however long or something, then you might not need the attribution process.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:27:54Mhm.+12*******42   1:27:58Because that's what we use. We just use the claims history to find to figure out what.What face to face visits they've had with a doctor that could represent the type of care that a PCP would give to a patient. So and then we if there's more than one provider that fits that bill in their claims history, in their recent claims history.Then we have some.matching and hierarchy rules to decide.Which provider wins out?And then we come up with a single provider that we think is accountable for their care for that period of time and.That process is post facets.And I was told that you guys needed the output of that process.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:28:59OK.So Nilesh, we we build based on our clinical data, we people that care team, right and the care team would.+12*******42   1:29:01OK.Oh.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:29:09I have not looked at the care team model.Nilesh Trivedi   1:29:10In in the.In the in the care team, what do we require is that practitioner role and the display?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:29:24OK, so do we do we need a specific member to member to particular PCP relationship with the care team?Nilesh Trivedi   1:29:26Assist you.Yes.No. So what we require is care team participant role system and care team participant role display. That is what we do require.Whoever is this, So what is their role? So if we do we consider the role PCP there or not depend though in that case we do require, but if it is not in that case we may not require that. So I think it depends that we need to check.How exactly it is showing, whether it is showing under a role system or not?+12*******42   1:30:06OK.Nilesh Trivedi   1:30:18But that that will be a part of the 0057, not now 915.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:30:27But I'm trying to get the context like so how?So how so this PCP attribution, how I think how would this would relate to the building equity like to serve that purpose then. So that's what I'm trying to piece together. It makes sense you're saying yes as part of the care team do we.Do we need a PCP information to attribution information to build that care team or so?+12*******42   1:30:59I don't know.Don't know the answer to that. I just know what we use it for analytically.So this is important for our relationship with those larger entities because we have per capita arrangements with them and we use this process to assign members to them to be accountable for.So it's part of our part of what drives our data exchange with these larger entities.Um.And we send them eligibility information and claims information and so on about those members that they're responsible for. But I don't know if that has any relation to what you guys are working on.So I know that that's part of the use case that that we do the attribute PCP attribution process for.I don't know if you guys need the information too, but I was told that you did, so I'm not sure what that would be for, but I was told that that was a requirement.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:32:10OK, uh.So now that brings a question. So do we need this number registrations? If we have building entities, do we need to head to there from or not? And what did? So can we get the data dictionary out of this for this?To with the context like what those entities for fields for so we can evaluate whether. So to Rich like this question is how this building and registration would be useful for us to building those.Organization.Um.So Rich, if you could provide us a little bit of context on like these data sets for the web registration building entities so we can take a look whether we would need to keep it accessible only. Now again, a lot of the information that Dan and you provided still makes me think it's.This probably stay only with the source only. We we really don't even for the PCP attribution and this information. I don't think we would still need a billing entities to from the registration information to derive that.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:33:27Yeah. So, so Dale or or Dan, can we get, it's really somebody from the digital engineering team that kind of owns that app and that data. I mean, I'm a, I'm a consumer of it.So I I do understand, but I don't. I don't want to be the one to, you know, communicate all all things about that data set, right?So, so I guess Dale, can we bring in somebody from the digital engineering team for for this one?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:34:00Yep.Dale Fryer   1:34:01Yeah.Yeah, let me find out who that would be.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:35:33And they would be the team would be providing those those data dictionaries, ERDs as well, correct?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:35:41Yeah, I mean, I I can give you queries. I've written over it that I've helped, you know, teams kind of extract data from it, but.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:35:44OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:35:49I don't. I don't want to be the one to talk about every every field on every table, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:35:56OK then.And we we don't know the how the say if you're going to get this data given for ingestion perspective, right. Let's talk about the condition like we we don't know what that the delivery method or.Or the format and layout it's going to be right. So this is a altogether new addition so.Correct, Rich. So that is something to be decided.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:36:38So yeah, I mean to get it over to you, it would just be replicated in a in into the buckets.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:36:47Yeah, but then we don't know what the format is going to be. What I'm talking, yes, it's going to be bucket for sure, but we don't know the format yet or the structure is going to be it, so.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:36:51Right.Yeah.Correct.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:37:00OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:37:03Again, I've I've I've had to basically I've just had to, you know, figure out what was in there based on the file layout, right? And.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:37:13OK.Lorraine Maldonado   1:37:29Satish, can you just clarify is the first action item here for this particular one for us to receive like the DD information and ERD for us to look at or?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:37:37So yes, a couple of action item, Lauren, we we do need to have a DDD and ERD on top of that I think. So which here from the perspective of how is consuming the data, right. But there are other aspects of it. Dan was saying no, we need this.Lorraine Maldonado   1:37:45Mhm.Mhm.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:37:57For specific PCP attribution or link between member and provider, I don't see how, but we need a general context on this like to provide OK what is this data about and beyond beyond the building and registrations, how what is the business use case for this data would be?Lorraine Maldonado   1:38:05Right.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:38:15I think that should come from the digital team that Rich was talking about. They're going to pull in to this conversation.Lorraine Maldonado   1:38:15Mhm.Right.So, OK, that's great. That's what I was understanding. But is Rich, are you going to help us to identify who those folks are so we can set set up a conversation?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:38:29Hold on Lauren, before before that did Kelly, you had some questions on this. Is it like good or like we we can go the what we discussed before?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:38:34Sure.Kelly Good Clark   1:38:48Sorry, what?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:38:50Do do you have any questions? I thought I you were cut off so.Kelly Good Clark   1:38:50Questions.No, no, I I I wasn't saying anything. No, that might have been someone else.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:38:55On.OK. OK. Yeah. So, Lauren, I think, yeah, go ahead.Lorraine Maldonado   1:39:02You know, I just, I was just trying to clarify in my head here is Rich, is Rich, are you the person who's going to help us get in touch with the right SME from the digital team to help us to understand this business context and also you know maybe maybe help to review those ERD&DD details?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:39:17Oh.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:39:21I think Dale was gonna reach out to the digital team to try to figure out who the right contact is. I can certainly add and support that person.Lorraine Maldonado   1:39:24Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah.+12*******42   1:39:27Perfect.Dale Fryer   1:39:29OK.Lorraine Maldonado   1:39:32Sounds good. That's I just wanted to. I wasn't sure. Thank you.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:39:33Yep. No, that's good.Nilesh Trivedi   1:39:41Satish, can we check about the formulary? Do we have any inputs on that?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:39:47Right. So now it's close open to you Nilesh. I think we're done with the source until so the next set of things. OK, before we jump into that Nilesh, let so we still need a clarification on it can. I think Tamera's not here anymore here again.Nilesh Trivedi   1:40:01We we need clarification on the formulary as well, right Satish? Because we mentioned it as open question. Is that related to?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:40:05Yes, yes. No, I'm going going on, so this, this.Dale Fryer   1:40:12Is that related to the questionnaire that Lorraine sent me yesterday? Is that what the formulary API data you're looking for?Well, I'll, I'll let you move forward. I don't know if that's something different, but we did receive a questionnaire that we have to work on, but we've not completed it and sent that back to you. Is that what you're asking about?Nilesh Trivedi   1:40:24Yes, yes.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:40:34No, this is more than that. So is it Rich I'm talking to or Dominic?Dale Fryer   1:40:38OK.No, this is Dale. This is Dale.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:40:42Dale, hey Dale, this remember like there's two pending items, right? I think one was formally data set. BCA today don't have that formally data set both incrementally today as well as historically.But the challenge is I think either Dan or someone said that we do get that in the form of Excel, but it was not really stored anywhere else. But then that the question came from us like the compliance if you're getting it from the Excel then technically.Health plan asks the formula information, which means that mandate request to provide that. So how are we going to approach that? Whether we're going to get that ingestion data from the formula side and I think either Richard or Dan.So Dan, one of you is going to reach out to the for the historical data for the CVS to get the formulary data. It's possible or to decide whether we just forget it or he's going to take the compliance.Right. That's on the formula side on the RX was we prior to 2021, right Dan, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm saying let me go over there.Oh.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:42:07Do do you want it before we go into RX? Do you want to finish the formulary?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:42:11Yeah, yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:42:12OK, so there's no need to go get any history around formulary.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:42:19OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:42:21OK. And I think that I don't know if Dan nor I had the action item to try to reach out to.Um.+12*******42   1:42:30Oh.Kelly's been driving that appreciated Kelly. So Kelly and I are talking to the pharmacy folks to see if we can get the formula and what it will include.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:42:33To.OK.+12*******42   1:42:47I'd like to have the formulary history, but I don't know that that's possible, so.For Rich, for your stuff, it sounded like you only care about the current state of the formulary.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:42:55Yeah, I would just, I I would mix.Dale Fryer   1:42:55We're we're tracking that.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:42:59Yeah, 'cause I and and that's great. I just wouldn't want to mix the streams, you know, convolute the conversation. It's hard enough trying to just get the formulary out of them.+12*******42   1:43:06Yes.Right. Yeah, I I doubt that they'll be willing to send us history, but we can ask.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:43:15I get it, yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:43:16This doesn't hurt to ask.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:43:23Anyway, Sir, OK, it's on the on the RX.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:43:26So on the RX part, I think prior to 2019 was serious care, serious care mark and I I I believe Danny said you prior to 2021 or 2022 you.You'd have that RX data from Carolyn, but it's all in on Prem would require a separate process to extract it or and send it to. There's two action to the RX1, the one the data sets that's from the care Caroline that's an on Prem today.+12*******42   1:43:54Google.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:44:02May not have all the fields that meets the requirement of the RXR like that's you you essentially you guys only stored enough information to support the business process needed.In the on Prem data and then prior to 2019 we don't have RX data. That's because that was before before CVS and if that's a mandate says like before we need to go as far as 29/20/16.+12*******42   1:44:32OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:44:36Then what's our plan for those historical collects information and if there is any, I think Dan is going to send for the once in the horn Prem going to send the data dictionary and we're going to do a a gap analysis that whether are we missing any key requirement field.So that would how then how the next order of step is like the how do we going to mitigate that two questions on those?Two action items.Uh, did I confuse you, Rich, or is that clear?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:45:22Was that to me?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:45:23No, this was the two action items. So either to you or Dan, either one of you.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:45:27Yeah.Andy, do you want to address that one?+12*******42   1:45:45Sure. Could you repeat the question, Sakish?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:45:49OK.So then the the specific on the RX part, the prior to 2021 we have historical data of the from the Caroline that's in the on Prem correct but we we may not have all the fields.+12*******42   1:46:08OK.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:46:08Persisted in the on Prem data around the RX claim. So one thing, so we can get that information, but we're just not sure we would add all the required fields, yeah.+12*******42   1:46:17It's organized. Yeah, it's just different. It's been loaded into a database and it's in a different format and so on than the incoming file. We do have a record, theoretically, of the line on the incoming file stored alongside the information.In that club service database, but it is just a big.BLOB of text or Jason.Or not JSO XML.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:46:47OK.Nilesh Trivedi   1:46:47So Satish, can can I add something here?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:46:51Sure.Nilesh Trivedi   1:46:52Yeah. So I think this is very important before proceeding with that, that it has to be checked with the the internal compliance office team to whether they want or not this required data, formulated data. So it is.With the the PCI whether to to check whether the compliance office to determine whether they want to have this parameter data available or not.+12*******42   1:47:13Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:47:19You're talking about formula data.+12*******42   1:47:20Yeah, so that that data would be critical if we need history prior to 2021 or if we need carve out pharmacy information, so third-party pharmacy.Nilesh Trivedi   1:47:21Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:47:35No, we we are talking about two different item, right. Dan, you're talking about the RX client, correct?+12*******42   1:47:37OK.Yeah, yeah. Those are two completely different things, but.Yep, I'm talking about all RX claims. We get seeds of RX claims where it is not our coverage, but it's our group. And so we ingest their claims. We refer to them as carve out pharmacy.Because the pharmacy plan isn't with us, but we still receive the claims and use them for group data analytics. So if you don't need that or if you don't need history prior to 2021 for the BCI pharmacy claims, then.You don't. We don't need to to try to dig out the history, but if we do need history prior to 2021, that's the only place to get it for pharmacy.Lorraine Maldonado   1:48:28So the question of whether we need it or not, I think is still a compliance, a BCI compliance question.+12*******42   1:48:29Is that understand?Yeah.I I think that's true, yeah.Lorraine Maldonado   1:48:39Yeah, so we still need to know the answer. Do we need it? Do we not? And then if we do need it, what are the next steps?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:48:47So, so even from beyond 2019 that 2016, so do we have the same level of reckon till 2016 that?+12*******42   1:48:55Yep. Yeah. We have previous pharmacy benefit management companies in there as well. We we should have back in 2010, so we should be covered there.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:48:57OK.OK.Oh yeah, you did show that. But OK, so then the next question is like do we prior to. So let's say if we draw the line in the sand for 2021 As for the compliance, BCU compliance will confirm, do we need?+12*******42   1:49:15Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:49:22Prior to 2021 RX data as well. Then the next step is to go and extract the data from the on-prem system, do a gap analysis. Do we need, do we have all the required elements to populate the data guide specific needs on the RX?Yeah, I said that that would be action item.So the Lauren, so for the 1st order of the question to clarify is OK, do we go or need all these prior historical or X claims?And so same for the formulary as well. Now let's finish off the next topic and then move to the formulary. So that is that is a first order question. If the answer is going to be yes from the BCA perspective compliance, then the next question is OK, how far?OK, we can get this data from the on Prem system and then the how far the gap do the gap analysis of we do have whether we have all the required data set required fields from the data code perspective.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:50:28OK, so if we so it.What's the most straight? How far back can we go with the easiest effort on on history, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:50:40Kind of, yes.+12*******42   1:50:422021 is the easiest, yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:50:48OK, so 20/20/19?+12*******42   1:50:51No, 2021.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:50:51Yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:50:52OK, so so.+12*******42   1:50:53Because they they delete all the feeds that come in, so we only have them from when we started recording them in the EDP.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:50:57Great.OK. So we're going to basically include history back to 2021, right?That's a given, is that correct?+12*******42   1:51:11Yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:51:12OK. So the question to compliance would be, do we have to go back farther?+12*******42   1:51:17Correct.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:51:18And so and so is it the level, is there an intermediate level of effort like we can go back prior to 2021 to this date with an incremental level of effort?K.+12*******42   1:51:38Because that's all carillon claims, so they have a similar layout and so on. So we already have. We've already done a similar mapping, right? It would be fairly identical to the mapping we already have. If this data would just be in a different format and then.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:51:47Great.OK.+12*******42   1:51:53Prior to 2019, we would have to get CVS data and that's in a different, that's in a separate format. So that would be another level of effort.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:51:58With.But we don't even have that data.+12*******42   1:52:03We go, we do in the claim service. We don't have the raw data.We have an XML representation of the raw data, plus some selected fields that are in a relational table, tabular format.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:52:09OK.OK.+12*******42   1:52:23And that's just, that's just a fraction of what's in the claim service. The claim service has all kinds of stuff, EDI and medical claims and all kinds of stuff in there. So we would only need the pharmacy claims out. I'm not sure if we would need the third party pharmacy claims or not, but.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:52:42OK.+12*******42   1:52:43That's where all that data is. So we could consume it as a source. We could just consume it as a separate source and put it in the bronze there so that we had it when we needed it. If we needed it, there's a few different levels like of solutioning that we could apply to it depending on what compliance says.OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:53:03OK, um.So again, I guess you know my my my recommendation to compliance would be like, well, we can go back to 2021 and I I personally do not think that there'll be a requirement to go back beyond 2021, but.We can double check that. So I think that our default position would be like, hey, we're targeting 2021, which we're going to have to do anyway. And then the question is whether we just have a separate conversion for the step from, you know, back to 2019.+12*******42   1:53:22OK.OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:53:38And then back beyond that, right, which are two different effort. They're separate efforts essentially.+12*******42   1:53:41Correct. Thank you.Yeah. So there's two separate efforts involved in getting all the way back to 2016, if that's what we're trying to do.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:53:50Right. But we could just like right now our courses back to 2021 RX history.+12*******42   1:53:58Yep.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:54:00OK, cool.+12*******42   1:54:01That's what we already have in S3 available to ingest.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:54:04The.Right. My only point is, yes, we're going to ask compliance, but we're not, quote, waiting for their answer to really plan our work. It'll just be extra work if they come back and say, yeah, you need to do that.Is that is that a decent way to look at it or? I mean, I just don't want to be in a holding pattern waiting for a response back from compliance.+12*******42   1:54:34Yeah, I get that.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:54:37OK.+12*******42   1:54:39It seems like a reasonable position to take because of the amount of effort to go back farther. We would want to make sure that it was necessary, but it's going to be necessary at some point for our analytical use cases, so it wouldn't be wasted time, but it might delay other parts of the project, if that makes sense so.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:54:51OK.I I see the point. OK, so we're gonna do it anyway, right?+12*******42   1:54:57It's good to put, OK?We're gonna have to, I think, yeah, I think we're gonna have to. There's there's a lot of analytical requirements around those older claims and the the carve out claims. So we'll have to do it in the EDP at some point, but it.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:55:02Yes.But.OK. Well, let me ask it this way. Compliance, yeah.+12*******42   1:55:16I don't have it on my road map right now. I don't have it on the road map till maybe the end of next year or something.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:55:23If compliance comes back and says no, don't need it, we're still gonna do the work. It's just that now shifts to ADP, right?+12*******42   1:55:29When it's just a question of when, yeah, and and and a question of whether it needs to go all the way into the Habitus Foundation marks or if it can just stay in the bronze layer.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:55:32OK, got it.Yep. Okay, that helps.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:55:55OK, so Rick, what did we decide on the formulary data, whether we are going to feed it or not?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:56:03You mean the history part or the?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:56:06Both history I I think currently we we say it doesn't house any form red data set, correct?+12*******42   1:56:11Yeah.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:56:11Right. I I think, I think Dan and Kelly are working on trying to get that data.+12*******42   1:56:13Yeah.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:56:13So.+12*******58   1:56:14Oh.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:56:17OK.Nilesh Trivedi   1:56:18So Satish, I I I believe they've been just checking internally with the compliance team and get back to us. That is what.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:56:24OK.+12*******42   1:56:24So what for the for the CMS part, what what do we need from the formula? Don't we need, we need the formulary for one of those CMS efforts, right?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:56:26OK.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:56:36Yeah, you have to. You have to surface the current. You have to surface the current formulary on the endpoint.+12*******42   1:56:37Either not more than five.And and which one is that? Is it both of them or just one of them, the 9115 and 0015 or whatever is 0057?Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:56:51Yeah, that that's a current, that's a current compliance regulation. So we're that we're currently under that requirement today.+12*******42   1:56:59OK, so it is a current CMS regulatory requirement to have the formulary information.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:57:05Yes, it's not feature dated.+12*******42   1:57:07Yeah, cool. Yeah, that's what I wanted to hear, because that gives us some some pretty solid reason to getting it and needing it. You know what I mean. So in the past we've been.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:57:08Yes.OK.+12*******42   1:57:21Fobbed off a little bit by the PDM S, because I don't. I think they don't want us to see their the tears and so on in a way that we can analyze, but they don't have a choice now, so that's good.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:57:36Use the term, use the term data blocker. They'll know what that has specific legal meaning, so.+12*******42   1:57:37OK.Nilesh Trivedi   1:57:37Oh uh.So.+12*******42   1:57:46OK.Nilesh Trivedi   1:57:47OK, so Satish, quick question to you. Did we cover the question about in earlier session I was not available. So did we cover the question about what the data which supposed to be get exclude like sensitive codes?+12*******42   1:58:04OK.Nilesh Trivedi   1:58:04Sensitive codes or any claim times which supposed not to be shared to the patient access API to the patients. Did we discuss about that?Sathish Dhanasekar   1:58:12No, we did not.Nilesh Trivedi   1:58:16OK, I think we are over time, so maybe next session we can have this.Rich Tallon - Contractor   1:58:21Yeah, I gotta. I gotta run. I'll get another meeting.Lorraine Maldonado   1:58:24Yeah, we are at time. I think that we should probably summarize where we've landed this week, but Dale, is Dale still on? It looks like we're going to need some additional time with your sneeze to kind of work through.Our remaining open items.Dale Fryer   1:58:44Yeah, so I'll follow up with that digital engineering team. As far as the data needed for Tamara, I put a note that she's not going to be able to attend, but I might need to work with someone else. Would you or Satish be able to give me a summary of what that data Tamara was?Um, identified to establish so that I can. Oh, awesome.Lorraine Maldonado   1:59:03I I sent. I did send the list of action items to you while we were on the call.Sathish Dhanasekar   1:59:10And so Dell if.Dale Fryer   1:59:10Oh, OK, I have the action items from you from yesterday. It's an updated one.Lorraine Maldonado   1:59:10Um.No, I I sent in the Tamra e-mail. There's a list of it's. It's not in that other list. So I did reply and I copied Satish. So currently those are the open items without yesterday's notes. They might be a little out of context though. We didn't share notes from yesterday.Dale Fryer   1:59:20OK, I'll.Lorraine Maldonado   1:59:33Combine with today's.But those are the open items if you see the e-mail.Dale Fryer   1:59:43OK.Lorraine Maldonado   1:59:43OK.But in addition to discussion with, yeah, but in addition to Tamara, I think we still have some other items here. I'll work with Satish maybe to find out what his recommendation is on our follow-up call for next week perhaps or who knows, maybe tomorrow, but.Dale Fryer   1:59:45I'm just looking right now. I got it.Lorraine Maldonado   2:00:02I guess we will. We're meeting right after this, Satish. We have an internal sync with you and the CSM soon.Sathish Dhanasekar   2:00:07Uh, it's I have. I have conflict. Uh.Lauren, I I have to join another meeting. Can we push that an hour half hour later and I could join?Lorraine Maldonado   2:00:20With me, we'll we'll check. We'll let's discuss internally with the CSM. We need to find a time to sync, so we'll we'll work that out. But OK for this call then. Thank you so much, Dale. We'll follow up.Sathish Dhanasekar   2:00:26Yeah.Lorraine Maldonado   2:00:35At some point this afternoon and with our request for sessions for next week and and I think Grant, you're on. I just want to make sure since you're on, there was an open item about you doing a full refresh. I don't know if you've got an official response back. I may have missed it.Sathish Dhanasekar   2:00:42Yep.Not yet. Well, I'll, I'll get, we'll, we'll, I'll get back to you client on that full refresh or not. Yeah, so.Lorraine Maldonado   2:00:55But.OK, OK.Grant Ballard   2:01:01That's that's that's all right because I ended up having to do a full reload to fix another problem. So.Lorraine Maldonado   2:01:08I think that was fine. Yeah, that would have been fine. I think we I did follow up with implementation and they were OK with it. I wasn't sure if. Anyway, thank you so much and appreciate your patience in this.Sathish Dhanasekar   2:01:09OK.OK, that was fine.So Lauren, I have to jump call. I'll I'll I'll ping you in a few minutes.Lorraine Maldonado   2:01:22Yes.Rich Tallon - Contractor   2:01:23OK.Nilesh Trivedi   2:01:24Satish, would you be joining our internal call or it's not possible?Lorraine Maldonado   2:01:26Thanks.Nilesh Trivedi   2:01:37OK.Lorraine Maldonado   2:01:3715 minutes, right?OK.OK.Lorraine Maldonado stopped transcription
