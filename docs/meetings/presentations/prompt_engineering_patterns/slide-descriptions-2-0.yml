    visual_direction: |
      Visual representation of a toolkit or toolbox concept.
      Five distinct tools or compartments, each representing one tier.
      Tools should be visually distinct and hint at their function:
      - Self-Correction: loop/cycle symbol
      - Meta-Prompting: nested boxes or recursion hint
      - Reasoning Scaffolds: ladder or framework structure
      - Perspective Engineering: multiple viewpoints/faces

        content: "Stop hallucinations before they commit"
    visual_direction: |
      Section divider slide with strong visual presence.
      Imagery suggesting error prevention or course correction:
      could be a compass self-adjusting, a path with a wrong turn being avoided,
      or a document with errors being caught and fixed.
      The "Tier 1" should be visually prominent as a badge or marker.
    notes: "First of five tier section openers - establish consistent visual pattern"

    visual_direction: |
      Circular or cyclical four-step loop diagram.
      Each step is a distinct node connected by directional arrows.
      Visual icons for each step:
      - Draft: document/pencil
      - Critique: magnifying glass or red pen
      - Verify: checklist or checkmark
      - Finalize: stamp of approval or polished document
      The loop should feel like a quality assurance process.

        content: "Red Team Persona"
    visual_direction: |
      Split or contrasting composition showing transformation.
      Left/default: friendly, helpful assistant character (the standard LLM persona).
      Right/activated: the same character transformed into an aggressive "Red Team" 
      security tester - could wear a red hat, have a more critical expression,
      hold a magnifying glass looking for vulnerabilities.
      Visual metaphor of breaking through the "helpful assistant" bias.
    notes: "Show the persona shift that enables finding vulnerabilities"

      Split-screen comparison layout.
      Left side: "Standard Prompt" with a failing SQL query result (red X, error state).
      Right side: "Edge-Case Primed Prompt" with successful SQL query (green checkmark, success state).
      Include visual representation of code/query blocks on each side.
      The contrast should be stark and immediately readable.
    notes: "Particularly effective for coding tasks like SQL generation"

      - type: tagline
        content: "Use AI to design better prompts"
    visual_direction: |
      Section divider slide with recursive/self-referential visual theme.
      Imagery suggesting AI helping to design prompts: could be nested boxes,
      a mirror reflecting improvement, or a blueprint being drafted by an AI hand.
      The concept of "prompts about prompts" should come through visually.
      "Tier 2" badge consistent with Tier 1 styling.
    notes: "Recursive concept - the AI improves its own instructions"

          - "2. Specify essential reasoning steps"
          - "3. Execute the AI-designed prompt"
    visual_direction: |
      Visual flow showing role reversal or backwards process.
      Instead of user → prompt → AI, show AI → prompt design → user approval → execution.
      Could use arrows flowing in unexpected direction, or show the AI
      holding a clipboard/checklist while the user reviews.
      Emphasize the "ask the expert to design the question" concept.
    notes: "Especially useful when you don't know what you don't know"

  - id: 11
    section: "Tier 2: Meta-Prompting"

      - type: progression
        content: ["Basic Prompt", "Add Constraints", "Add Error Handling", "Bulletproof"]
    visual_direction: |
      Iterative refinement visualization - could be:
      - A spiral staircase ascending toward quality
      - A rough sketch progressively becoming a detailed blueprint
      - A simple shape being refined through multiple passes
      Show 3-4 stages of evolution from rough to polished.
      Each iteration adds visible layers of robustness (shields, checks, armor metaphor).
    notes: "The prompt evolves through multiple critique-and-improve cycles"

      - type: tagline
        content: "Force systematic thinking"
    visual_direction: |
      Section divider featuring the "Intern" character from slide 2.
      The intern is studying a whiteboard or checklist, looking focused and methodical.
      Visual metaphor of scaffolding or framework structure supporting the thinking process.
      Construction scaffolding around a "thought" or "idea" being built.
      "Tier 3" badge consistent with previous tiers.
    notes: "Callback to intern metaphor - giving them structure to work within"

          - "Prioritize completeness"
          - "No summaries"
    visual_direction: |
      Contrast between thin/minimal output and thick/comprehensive output.
      Left: a tiny, sparse document (what the AI wants to produce).
      Right: a detailed, thorough document (what we actually need).
      Could show a funnel being reversed - expanding rather than condensing.
      Emphasize "more is more" for technical architecture tasks.
    notes: "Particularly important for technical architecture documentation"

  - id: 14

      - type: few_shot_content
        content: "Input → Reasoning → Output (with examples)"
    visual_direction: |
      Side-by-side comparison of two approaches.
      Zero-Shot side: simple, single instruction with a thought bubble.
      Few-Shot side: multiple example blocks showing the pattern (input box → 
      reasoning steps → output box), repeated 2-3 times to show examples.
      Visual emphasis on the structural difference between the approaches.
    notes: "Foundation technique - many other methods build on this"

      Detailed visualization of the few-shot learning process.
      Show a clear example with visible reasoning steps as a template,
      then an arrow pointing to a new problem being solved the same way.
      The AI is "mimicking" the demonstrated reasoning pattern.
      Could use IT troubleshooting as the visual context (computer, diagnostic steps).

      Visual of a "gold standard" or exemplar being used as a reference.
      Could show a trophy/medal document labeled "Gold Standard" with arrows 
      pointing to multiple output documents that match its style and quality.
      Emphasize matching: structure, tone, and quality level.
      Think of it like a style guide or template being followed precisely.
    notes: "Ensures consistency in output quality, structure, and tone"

      Could show a lightbulb with wild, creative ideas flowing out,
      but contained within a clearly marked "speculation zone" or boundary.
      Emphasize the balance: creativity is encouraged BUT must be labeled.
      Use caution colors (yellow/orange) for the speculative boundary.

      Professional, open composition inviting questions.
    notes: "Final slide - keep clean and focused on the resource link"
