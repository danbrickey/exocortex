# Network Set
networks that are in-network for a member/product (cspi.nwpr_pfx)
internal / external networks. do these need to be mapped? yes - crosswalk
lines of business 
- network 
- marketing
- finance
- facets/claims
- contracting (PPO,POS, TRAD, MA, etc. Plan Groupings in edw)

check NDW BCBSA Product mapping to see if it is the same as the provider network mapping to BCBSA networks

# Raw Vault 
Should the raw vault member hub use the gemstone business key for legacy members that were converted? Possibly. These memberships are seen as the same policy/contract/Product as the pre-conversion membership. Since there is no new contract with the group or member, maybe they should be keyed that way. This would require some compute up front, but it would save a bunch of headaches in the business vault. We would need to work out an efficient way to do this, compute-wise.
