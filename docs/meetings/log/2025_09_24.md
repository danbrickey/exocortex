## EDP roadmap meeting. 
Reviewed our sources with Lindsey. She is going through a process of trying to prioritize our ingestion for the next 24 months with the business. We went through some of the data sources that they had listed to determine whether they were official databases or systems, or whether they were single one-off data extracts or reports. We can add them to the inventory for the EDP. I think this is going to take us a couple of days to get through, so we'll probably meet again tomorrow and spend some more time going through the data and trying to classify it. 

## EDP Team One Sprint Planning 
Pulled in some stories for EDP team 1, for sprint 1 of this PI. My story primarily has to do with the transition of DBT over to the Franken environment and adapting to the renaming of the Franken environment. I'll continue to meet with the data engineers who use dbt tomorrow. 

## Dbt transitioned to Franken. 
Worked with the data engineers on the transition and finished testing the EDP source data project that seems to be working. The engineers had homework to go set up their own credentials and make sure that works with Franken for that project. We got started testing the EDP Data Domains project. We reconfigured it, merged those changes in from the code, and changed the environment configuration. That all went really well until we tried to run a job in the Team Dev environment. When it tried to clone the GitHub repository, the authentication failed. I'll work with Sean Trent tomorrow to figure out what that is. And then meet with the data engineers again to continue pressing forward. In theory, the Franken environment is going to be renamed to dev as the prefix instead of Franken, and that change should hit us tomorrow afternoon. So hopefully we will be prepared for it and then we'll roll through and make those changes either late tomorrow or early Friday, I guess. 

## One-on-one with Rob. 
Rob and I discussed the current state of the legacy EDW. It's been quite a while since people have started talking about decommissioning. So Rob still thought there might be some processes that the business has running on that server, even though they're probably not dependent on the legacy EDW data anymore. A lot of them built processes and everything on that server around the EDW, which are still there. 

## Provider 360 modeling alignment. 
Nicole Bowen, Tina Day, and I met and talked through the requirements gathering process for the Provider Data Council and what we might change about the process as we engage with the Membership Data Council and the Product Data Council that we are getting ready to kick off. We decided that we would try to come up with a modeling approach that would speak well to the business and come up with some examples before a meeting on Tuesday afternoon or maybe the following meeting. And that we would try to align on some metrics and some naming for what was formerly known as the provider engagement fact. One of our departments is called Provider Engagement. We didn't know that when we were making up the fact names, so we're going to brainstorm for some different ones to suggest to the business. 

## Project kick-off with Abacus interop for prior auth and FHIR 
We met with Abacus to kick off the engagement with Abacus and our interoperability agreement. The statement of work is signed, and so they start on Monday of next week. It looks like the timeline stretches into the end of summer next year, and possibly a little later for testing and deployment. They'll be working on two CMS requirements that mandate that they come our way:
1. CMS-9115
2. CMS-0057
These have to do with interoperability and API access with our business partners and providers.They're also going to be doing the plan on work for ingesting several of our source system data and feeding to us through a Snowflake share access to that raw data as well as some pre-processed "silver" layer data that they call foundational data marks that we should be able to build analytics on top of. Anyway, good meeting. They seemed very competent and on the ball, pretty sharp, knew their stuff.
