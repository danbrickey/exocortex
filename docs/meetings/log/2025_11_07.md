# One-on-one meeting with Ram

# EDP Team 1 Office Hours. 
Demo documentation created by our code refactoring process that I've gotten working. I think Ram will be happy to see that even if it's on a smaller scale than the effort we wanted to do. 

# DBT error work party session 3 
I met with Sumedh, Brad, and Carl again to discuss the member consecutive coverage issue. I've made progress on fixing the root cause in the temporal merge process. I've incorporated the changes into the dbt model and they are now testing them to ensure they resolve the issue.
