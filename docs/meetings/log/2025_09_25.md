Worked on a way of diagramming under the C4 diagramming method, where I can have a level, an executive and managerial level of the diagram that appeals to the business, and the more detailed diagrams can be referred to by the engineering teams.This method combines C4 diagramming with domain-driven design concepts and terminology. 

We were having problems with our Github repository. The authentication wasn't working. Worked with Sean Trent for a little while. We couldn't figure everything out. We contacted dbt support and they were able to give us the missing piece, and so that is working now. 

We haven't quite finished testing, but everything looks like it is working in the new dev environment in North Star. We're still going through some testing steps, but everything looks good so far. 

## One view dependency on CSV to enable real-time data. 
Met and discussed the dependency that OneView has on real-time data stream. We talked about how to use the CSV files that are building in the S3 buckets in AWS to create what we're calling a deferred merge view that takes the stuff already ingested into the table and combines it with the things in the stream that are waiting to go into the table to create a close to real-time view of the data without having to load the batches More frequently. So it's deferring the merge we have to do to do the physical load of the data until later. That way we can batch load the data every 4 hours, but have another stream on a relatively small number of tables that is close to real-time. We went over that with Ranga, our Snowflake consultant, and we went over three different options. This is the one we decided to try first, so we are just getting all the pieces in place to try that. 

## Project issue meeting with Sean Trent. 
As mentioned above, worked with Sean for quite a while on straightening out our repository that got deleted and restored last week and making sure that dbt, the dbt connection was valid, which took some time to figure out, but it is working now.
