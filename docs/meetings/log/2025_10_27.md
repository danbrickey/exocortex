# Business alignment stretch goals for the EDP. 
I met with Lindsey, Tyler, Tina, and Nicole from Data Governance. We discussed the state of the current 24-month roadmap for the EDP and how we are aligning to business units. We talked about how do we connect the requirements gathering and governance work that they need to do with the business rule documentation and code that we need to put together so that we can make sure our processes line up. 

# Scrum of scrums 
We talked about the ongoing deprecation of Rising Sun account and morphing it into a sandbox environment. There is one remaining dependency on that, which is the existing dev environment in Rising Sun needs to stay around for a couple weeks so that they can complete some testing that they are doing that's specific to that environment. Once they're done with that, they'll be able to move to North Star. And while they're doing that, the NS_data_gov_DB database has to stay in place because that is what is enforcing all of the masking rules, which are important for that particular set of testing. 

# other tasks
Had a meeting with Kelly, Lakshmi, Leonardo, and some data governance folks to discuss naming conventions. We're going to name dynamic tables "Dyn", and then Lakshmi's team is going to start moving their workflows into dbt. They're going to schedule a one-hour meeting with me later this week to walk them through exactly how to create a consumption layer view to consume their raw layer information. 

Talked with Leonardo about setting up a 1-hour demo with his team later this week for dbt. 

I worked on getting caught up with the merge request that we're waiting to be approved, got all that done, and I am working on creating new membership/product data pipeline specs for Locandra and Shweta.
