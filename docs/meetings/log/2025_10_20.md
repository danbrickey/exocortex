# Provider Business Vault MVP Sync 
Discussed what we could work on for the Provider Business Vault MVP while Martin is here for this week. We discussed the possibility of doing PCP attribution, the provider dimension, and a member months output. I am going to look into them later today, and then in our working session this afternoon, we'll decide which one we'll work on. 

# EDP and Data Governance 
This data governance meeting was mostly around provider. We talked with Lori Olson, Cassie Morton, Lindsey Smith, Nicole Bowen from the EDP project, as well as myself. We talked about the role of the data stewards in the EDP, and we discussed the possibilities and what types of things they would be required to do to support our data quality efforts and our data governance efforts. Laurie and Cassie were really receptive, and I think this opens the door to a good working relationship and hopefully much higher data quality standards. 

# EDP Team 1 stand-up. 
Discussed where we're at with the sprint, and tomorrow is the end of the sprint, so we discussed what would be done by tomorrow and what wouldn't. 

# Scrum of scrums 
We discussed the state of the EDP project and what each team is working on and what dependencies they might have. We resolved a couple of minor things, but it was the meeting was fairly short today, over in fifteen or twenty minutes. 

# Working session With Martin to discover what to do with his last week.  
Decided to work on PCP attribution, replication in the EDP with Martin. I exported the code and DAG and sent that information to him along with some DDL and a screenshot of the Warescape objects that are associated with it.
