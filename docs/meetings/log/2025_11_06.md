# DBT roadmap review with DBT technical team. 
I met with Delaney Boohoff and Kevin Born from DBT, and they went over upcoming features that are on the roadmap and recently released features. We invited all the data engineers to come to that and listen to it. Delaney also offered to record the call and send the recording out, so that's pretty good for anybody who missed it.

The discussion mostly focused around AI tooling and using VS Code to edit our dbt repository and run dbt packages. There has been a new extension for dbt code, but we haven't quite gotten it to register successfully yet. Also, there is more dbt co-pilot functionality on the horizon where it's going to start becoming more and more aware of our code repo and allow us to work on multiple files at a time and so on. 

# NDW code refactoring. 
I met with Cameron and Brian, who are working on refactoring the NDW code so that it runs in HDS entirely without relying on the legacy ETL engine. Because the ATL engine is getting old enough that it doesn't really work anymore. We knew we were on borrowed time long, long time ago when we started moving to Werescape and we lost our FTE that was maintaining the ETL engine code. That was about ten years ago, nine years ago, maybe, and so we've milked it for quite a while. We need to get the NDW workflow converted over, so that's what Brian and Cameron are working on. We found a few problems, troubleshot them, and then Cameron was going to get back to me if they ran into more issues.
1. The first issue was just a missing user-defined function in the environment that was part of the old legacy environment.
2. A couple of changes to make to the code to make it run in the new environment that we're still kind of referencing old environment tables and so on.For member demographics, we got that running sort of. Brian is going to check the output/results and see if they're valid. 

# Operating Model: New Positions 
Ram called this meeting for the whole data and analytics department. I think we had almost a hundred percent turnout, and ROM discussed upcoming position changes. They are taking some of the turnover changes that have happened in the last few months and converting them to new job descriptions focused around Snowflake and solution architecture. So, those job postings for the old openings are going to come down, and next week, job postings for the new positions are going to go up. He said we are welcome to apply for them for internal people, but it sounded like the job requirements were going to be written in such a way that that would probably exclude most of our internal folks. 
He said for now, the team organization is not going to change in terms of reporting chains, although that is still on the table as David Yu continues with planning the new organization for the IT department. 

# dbt error work party round 2. 
Sumedh, Brad, and Carl again talked about the member consecutive coverage issue. I think we found the root of the problem in the code. I'm going to work tonight and tomorrow morning on trying to get that to work because I think I understand that the issue now. It's a relatively complex part of the date-range merging process. Rather than have Sumedh or Brad work on it when they're not that experienced with it, I'm going to see if I can fix it. Hopefully that will take less time, and then we'll meet again tomorrow. 

# Non-meeting time. 
I spent about an hour working on that temporal merge process and got it working. It was actually more problems than I thought there were. The main problem was that the refactoring process tried to create a cross join to replicate the creation of all possible start and end dates from the data, and it didn't really do it correctly. It did it correctly from one point of view but not the way we needed it to, so I fixed that and fixed a couple of problems. I think this is the root problem really, the biggest problem was that we are having the incorrect membership populating the table to begin with, and then the process to merge those date ranges got confused. And started dropping date ranges because of the cross joins and/or because of the way the cross joins were implemented. So I rewrote that, about half of the code, but it wasn't that difficult to rewrite, and I did get it working. So tomorrow morning, I will see if I can incorporate that into the dbt model.
