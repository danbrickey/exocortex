**Gifts That Were Home Runs** (reference these patterns!):
- Skincare (Korean beauty products) - 2019 was a skincare-heavy year, worked well
- Quality kitchen gadgets (Ninja Creami) - major gift success
- Self-care items (massagers, heated eye mask) - consistent theme
- Quality outerwear (Vest, Boots) - invests in good pieces

**Gifts That Missed the Mark** (avoid these patterns):
- [Need feedback]
- Note: Nerf gun (2017) was probably playful/fun, not her core interest
