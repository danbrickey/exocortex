I spent most of the day on Friday, September 19th, dealing with a repo deletion. This is one of the dangers of working in healthcare. Our code repository was mistakenly identified as having PHI and clear text. In the code and the code repository was backed up and deleted. This was an unpleasant surprise for my team since that file didn't contain PHI, just very PHI-like test data. I don't really blame the scan for picking it up, although it was unfortunate that they didn't notify us before removing the repository. Anyway, we restored the develop branch from backup, and I spent the rest of the day setting up the branch and protection rules and other main branches and getting them all in sync. Still have some branch protection rules to add on Monday, but other than that, it's all back on its feet. Code is running in each of the three major environments, and that is good news. That means we are ready to start the migration over to North Star from the Rising Sun Snowflake account for development. I have a meeting scheduled for Monday afternoon with the data engineering developers to begin that migration.
