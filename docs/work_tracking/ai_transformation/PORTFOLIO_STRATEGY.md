- ✅ Healthcare domain expertise visible
- ✅ Measurable business impact in both projects
- ✅ Ready for job applications, interviews, conferences
- ✅ Strong foundation for master's program (Fall 2026)

**External Presence**:
- LinkedIn: 2 project posts
- GitHub: 1-2 repos (anonymized)
- Resume: Both projects featured
- Conference: 1-2 talk proposals submitted (optional)

**Career Plan Alignment**:
- Phase 0 complete (workflow optimization)
- Portfolio Projects #1 and #2 complete (ahead of career plan!)
- External presence building
- Master's application complete (UVU, submitted Dec 2025)
- Ready for Q2-Q3 2026 AI transformation work

## Why This Strategy Works

### 1. Operational + Portfolio Dual Purpose
- Not creating portfolio work in isolation
- Solving real business problems that ALSO demonstrate expertise
- Efficient use of time (one effort, two benefits)

### 2. Controlled Timeline
- UC02: You control pace (not dependent on stakeholders)
- Document AI POC: Officially assigned with dedicated time
- Risk mitigation through parallel tracks

### 3. Complementary Projects
- UC02: Migration + Architecture + Data Vault
- Document AI: Unstructured data + LLMs + Cortex
- Together: Broad AI expertise demonstration

### 4. Portfolio Polishing is Lightweight
- UC02 operational work (Oct-Dec) is the heavy lift
- Portfolio polish (January) is mostly documentation
- Can leverage personal time (10-12 hours/week) if needed

### 5. Early Career Plan Success
- Career plan expected 1 POC by Q1 2026 end
- This strategy delivers 2 portfolio projects
- Ahead of schedule, reducing pressure for Q2-Q3 2026

## Integration with Career Plan

**Career Plan Reference**: `docs/goals/career_goals/career_plan.md`

### Updated Timeline Alignment

**Phase 0 (Oct-Nov 2025)**: Delegation and workflow optimization
- ✅ UC02 IS workflow optimization (AI-assisted migration workflow)
- ✅ Delegation happening in parallel
- ✅ Evidence of AI capability building

**Revised Q1 2026 Focus**:
- **Original plan**: Contract Benefits POC only
- **Updated plan**: UC02 portfolio polish (January) + Document AI POC (Jan-Mar)
- **Result**: Two projects instead of one

**Q2-Q3 2026**: External presence and portfolio expansion
- UC02 and Document AI POC ready for conference talks
- LinkedIn presence building
- Potential for additional POCs or AI enablement programs
- Focus shifts to AI Office Hours, AI Champions Network (May-June)

**Fall 2026**: Master's program start
- Two portfolio projects ready as case studies
- Evidence of AI transformation leadership at BCI
- Strong application materials

---

## Risk Management

### Risk: Trying to Do Too Much
**Mitigation**:
- UC02 operational work is happening anyway (accelerates personal work)
- Portfolio polish is mostly documentation (lightweight)
- Document AI POC is officially assigned (not extra work)
- Total AI time: 25-30 hours/week (within capacity from Phase 0)

### Risk: Document AI POC Gets Delayed
**Impact**: Low - UC02 is independent and can complete on schedule
**Response**: Focus on UC02 completion, extend Document AI into Q2 if needed

### Risk: UC02 Doesn't Yield Good Examples
**Impact**: Medium - portfolio relies on good examples
**Mitigation**: Already have class_type as strong baseline
**Response**: Focus portfolio on 2-3 best examples, note lessons learned
