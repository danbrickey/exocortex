# My Ethical Operating System v1.0

## Epistemological Foundation
- Agnostic stance: Knowledge of divine reality is epistemologically unavailable
- Commitment to truth-seeking, even if findings are uncomfortable
- Willing to follow evidence, but require genuine evidence
- Moral framework does not require theological foundation

## Core Philosophical Influences
1. **Stoicism** - Decision-making framework, resilience, focus on what's controllable
2. **Virtue Ethics** - Character development goals, human excellence
3. **Secular Buddhism** - Psychological tools, suffering reduction, present-moment awareness

## Provisional Core Values (to be tested and refined)
[You'll fill this in this week based on your intuition inventory]

## Integrated Practices
- **Daily:** [Stoic morning reflection? Buddhist meditation? Evening review?]
- **Decision-making:** [Dichotomy of control + virtue consideration + compassion check]
- **Character development:** [Which virtues am I actively cultivating?]

## Open Questions I'm Exploring
- How do I build meaning without theological narrative?
- What does "living well" look like specifically for me?
- How do I practice compassion without moral superiority?
- How do these frameworks apply to my specific life domains (work, family, self)?
