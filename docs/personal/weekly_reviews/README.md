# Weekly Reviews

## Purpose
Synthesize the week's daily journals into:
- Accomplishments summary
- Progress on BCI goals and career goals
- Delegation tracking and insights
- Next week's priorities
- Patterns and learnings

## Format
- One file per week: `YYYY_Wxx_review.md` (e.g., `2025_W42_review.md`)
- 30-45 minutes every Friday afternoon or Monday morning
- Review daily journals from the week
- Connect tactical work to strategic goals

## Usage
- Review Monday-Friday daily journals
- Summarize key accomplishments
- Track progress against goals in `goals/bci_goals/` and `goals/career_goals/`
- Identify patterns and insights
- Plan next week's priorities

## Why Weekly Reviews Matter

- **Surfaces patterns** (e.g., delegation anxiety trends)
- **Prevents drift** from goals
- **Feeds monthly reviews** (so you don't have to remember everything)
