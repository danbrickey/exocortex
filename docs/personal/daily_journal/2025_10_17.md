# all employee town hall meeting. 
At our third quarter all-employee in town hall meeting today, executives spoke about our mission, about Jumpstone Holdings, about the different products we're spinning off, and how we're losing less money than we thought we would. I worked on documentation. 

# Pharmacy Formulary
I met with Kelley Good Clark, Rich Tallon, Natalie Blaning, and Jefferson Bohan to discuss the possibility of getting a formulary sent to us from our pharmacy benefit manager. PBMs have in the past been unwilling to send us the formulary because they maintain the benefits and the formulary on their system. The discussion now is based on CMS mandates, which are a little more critical to me. Of course, so Jefferson is going to look into it. He didn't know if we could get a flat file feed or if it would be an API access type of deal, but he's going to get back to us. 

# Delphi Estimation Meeting - Ruby 
I attended a Delphi Estimation meeting on the new subsidiary of Gemstone Holdings which is Ruby. Ruby is going to be a service that sells data or data services. So business partners would send us their data in a standard format, we would collect it, process it, and give it back to them for ingestion or for reporting and so on. This effort is going to be run by the health care economics department on the business side. So, data and analytics department won't have a piece of it. But we were asked to consult in the estimation process. So James Mills and I mostly with cybersecurity folks offered our input on the things that they discussed.
