# BCI data sources discovery. With Abacus 
continued going through their list of data sources, describing each one, and talking about each one and which pieces were important. 

# Pipeline questions. 
Met with Shweta and Lokendra to discuss some difficulties they're having with the data pipelines in dbt. I promised to take a look at the benefit summary pipeline which is failing on a unique key and Locandra can't figure out why. 
Update: The issues with the test failures on the benefit summary pipeline are due to the source being case-sensitive and the hashing algorithm used in Automate DV is not case-sensitive.Since the variations in casing and facets are considered a mistake, typo, or duplicate record, we have decided to go with a qualify clause on some of these tables that have this type of duplication and sort it by a case-insensitive version of the code (whatever the key is). And then obviously by the EDP start date. That's what we're going to do. We may have to come back and tweak it a little bit if that's not the right answer.
