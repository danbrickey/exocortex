## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Risk: UVU Application Not Accepted

**Likelihood**: Low (strong background, relevant experience)

**Mitigation:**
- Apply to backup programs (Boise State, online programs like Georgia Tech OMSCS, UT Austin)
- Strengthen application with additional projects or certifications if needed
- Consider deferring for one year and reapplying with even stronger portfolio

**Contingency:**
- Continue self-directed learning (online courses, certifications)
- Pursue AI role transition without master's degree (may limit options)
- Apply to alternative master's programs

### Risk: Work-School Balance Too Challenging

**Likelihood**: Medium (common challenge for working professionals)

**Mitigation:**
- Set realistic expectations for both work and school
- Communicate with Blue Cross leadership about time commitments
- Use Blue Cross projects as coursework to reduce duplication
- Plan lighter work project load during Semesters 4-5
- Build support system (family, study group, mentors)

**Contingency:**
- Take reduced course load (extend program by 1 semester)
- Take semester off if needed (programs allow up to 5 years)
- Reduce Blue Cross scope temporarily (if supported)

### Risk: Blue Cross Doesn't Invest in AI

**Likelihood**: Medium (organizational priorities can shift)

**Mitigation:**
- Build portfolio that's transferable to external roles
- Maintain external network and visibility throughout
- Document all work to showcase in job search
- Plan for external transition if Blue Cross doesn't evolve

**Contingency:**
- Accelerate job search timeline (start exploring Fall 2027)
- Leverage master's degree for external transition
- Network aggressively to secure AI role at target companies

### Risk: AI Job Market Changes

**Likelihood**: Medium (technology markets are dynamic)

**Mitigation:**
- Build skills across all three career paths (flexibility)
- Healthcare domain expertise as differentiator (less affected by general AI market)
- Focus on applied AI, not research (more stable demand)
- Maintain data architecture expertise as fallback

**Contingency:**
- Emphasize data + AI hybrid roles
- Target healthcare-specific AI roles (less competition)
- Consider adjacent roles (Data Architect with AI focus, AI Product Manager)

### Risk: Burnout from Work + School + External Activities

**Likelihood**: Medium-High (very full schedule for 2.5 years)

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize ruthlessly (say no to low-value activities)
- Build in recovery time (lighter semesters, breaks)
- Set boundaries (work hours, study hours, family time)
- Self-care practices (exercise, sleep, hobbies)

**Contingency:**
- Reduce external activities (pause guest lectures, limit conferences)
- Extend master's program timeline if needed
- Reduce work scope with Blue Cross approval
- Take semester off if burnout becomes severe
