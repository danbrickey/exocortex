# Personal Statement - MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence
**Dan Brickey | Utah Valley University**

---

After 27 years building enterprise data platforms, I could coast comfortably on what I know. But I'm a builder, and I don't want to watch the AI revolution from the sidelines—I want to help build build it. The past few years, I saw AI go from a sort of novelty chat experience that couldn't do much real work, to writing code, documentation, even reasoning through complex data architecture problems. I watched my team's productivity transform as they learned to work alongside AI tools. Unlike a few of my coworkers, I didn't see a threat to my expertise. I saw the foundation I'd spent decades laying suddenly capable of supporting something cathedral-scale. Every data vault I've designed, every integration pattern I've mastered, every governance framework I've built for healthcare's regulated complexity—all of it becomes exponentially more powerful through AI. I'm not applying to this program {to bail out my career/with no idea how to apply what I learn/because I want an AI job}. I'm applying because I see what needs to be built, my fingers are itching to build it, and I refuse to watch the most consequential transformation in data architecture happen without me.

**What I Hope to Achieve**

Through the MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence program, my goal is to formalize my hands-on AI experience into structured expertise that accelerates my evolution from data architect to AI solutions architect. I'm currently leading Blue Cross of Idaho's Enterprise Data Platform migration to Snowflake, integrating dozens of data sources across claims, clinical, provider, and financial systems. I've begun training and learning with my team to leverage AI tools. But it is difficult to lead teams using only self-directed learning. I need the academic rigor to deeply understand machine learning foundations, AI systems implementation, and the ethical frameworks essential for deploying AI in healthcare's regulated environment. This degree will provide credentials that signal my AI expertise to the market, but more importantly will fill critical knowledge gaps in Python for AI, advanced ML techniques, and MLOps practices.

**Why UVU's Program Meets My Needs**

The MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence at UVU is aligned well with how I work. As a practitioner building real solutions—not a researcher pursuing theoretical advances—I need an applied focus. UVU's emphasis on strategic implementation of AI across industries matches my orientation exactly. The part-time online format allows me to maintain full-time employment, effectively using our Enterprise Data Platform as a laboratory for every assignment. Courses like Data Strategy and Management for AI directly leverage my extensive data architecture background, while Ethical Legal and Social Implications of AI aligns perfectly with the AI governance frameworks I'm already developing for healthcare compliance. Also compelling for me is the fact that the Applied AI Capstone offers an opportunity to document part of my professional AI transformation as a publishable case study—turning two years of real-world work into academic contribution.

**My Readiness for This Program**

My career has been a continuous progression through platform transformations: from custom .NET systems to WhereScape automation, from on-premises warehouses to Snowflake cloud platforms, from traditional ETL to modern Data Vault architectures. Each transformation taught me how to lead teams through technological change while maintaining business continuity. Beyond technical depth, I bring three years of adjunct teaching at Boise State University, where I made enterprise database concepts accessible to students transitioning from desktop tools. That experience—combined with 15+ years mentoring data engineers gave me a love for learning complex concepts and making them clear to others.

I'm not transitioning to AI; I'm evolving my expertise to architect the AI-powered solutions healthcare desperately needs. AI doesn't replace data platforms—it makes them exponentially more valuable. And AI needs exactly what I've spent years building: high-quality, well-governed data managed by professionals who understand regulatory compliance, patient privacy, and clinical workflows.

**Looking Forward**

My immediate goal is to transform Blue Cross's data platform into AI-ready infrastructure and position the organization as a leader in responsible healthcare AI adoption. Longer-term, I see myself as an AI Solutions Architect—a bridge-builder who translates between AI capabilities and healthcare realities, between technical teams and business stakeholders, between what's possible and what's compliant. Professionals who can combine AI expertise with deep domain experience will be a durable part of the future of how we use AI to manage data.

I'm ready to bring my experience, my passion for learning, and my commitment to ethical AI to the UVU community. The foundation is laid. It's time to build the cathedral.
