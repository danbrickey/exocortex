Vision: Be an architect who creates an island of competency in a sea of organizational dysfunction

## **Here's the pattern**:
You delegate with scaffolding
   ↓
People practice and develop
   ↓
They become more competent
   ↓
You can delegate more confidently
   ↓
You have bandwidth for architecture
   ↓
You improve department systems/standards
   ↓
Department becomes more competent
   ↓
Easier to delegate (better team)
   ↓
More bandwidth for strategic work
   ↓
Positive cycle continues

What this looks like practically:

## **Within 3 months**:

- EDP Teams have clear technical standards everyone follows
  - Code review standards?
  - Documentation requirements?
  - Design pattern library?
  - Mentoring program?
  - Technical learning sessions?
- People come to me for architectural guidance (not to do their work)
- Mentored 2-3 people to handle tasks I used to do (code refactoring, simple design, code reviews, etc.)
- Documentation is comprehensive enough that people can self-serve
  - Documentation in a code repo or Confluence
  - come up with a document organization that the business can make sense of as well, they can drill for details if they want, things just get more technical farther doewn the tree. Leverage C4 diagraming levels here to match architecture diagrams. 
  - Design C4 Diagrams in LucidChart, well socialized
  - Documents aligned with business function
- Spending 50% of my time on strategic work (up from 20%)
- Strategic oversight (I guide, review, develop, set standards)

## **Within 6 months**:

- Department has measurably better technical practices
- Have a pipeline of developed talent ready for the next level in their career
- Executive-level confusion doesn't cascade down as much because you've created stability. 
- Ram (Director of Data and Analytics) and David (CIO) gain some enthusiasm for the improvements we are making - need to communicate and demo that for them somehow.
- Be an architect who builds capability, not just builds systems
- Spending 60-70% of time on work I actually love
- My day is becoming limited to these activities:
  - Design the system
  - Set the standards
  - Review the implementation
  - Ensure quality at the integration points
  - Develop the builders

## **Within 1 year**:

- My areas of responsibility are noticeably more functional than the rest of the org
- Built enough competency that I can delegate confidently
- Doing almost entirely architecture work
- People seek transfer into my department because it's less dysfunctional
- Prove that creating local competency is possible even in a dysfunctional org, or if it isn't, hit the job market with new skills and professional framework that another company would value.
