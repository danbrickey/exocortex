# Why I'm Building This

## The Problem I'm Solving
I'm drowning in doing everyone else's work in a dysfunctional organization. 
This is unsustainable and keeps me from doing the architecture work I'm good at and love.

## The Vision
Build an island of competency in my department where:
- Technical standards are clear and followed
- People are developed and capable
- I can focus on strategic architecture work
- We prove excellence is possible even in organizational dysfunction

## What I'm Working Toward

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation
**Personal:** Delegate 3-5 tasks/week consistently, free up 30% of time
**Visible:** Complete C4 docs for one system, create doc framework, draft standards
**Team:** Identify 2-3 mentees, begin their development
**Outcome:** Bandwidth to think strategically, visible proof of competency

### Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Expansion  
**Personal:** 60-70% time on strategic work
**Visible:** Standards adopted, measurable improvements, executive awareness
**Team:** Mentees handling tasks I used to do, talent pipeline forming
**Outcome:** I'm architecting, they're executing, leadership notices

### Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Maturity
**Personal:** Confident delegation, doing work I love, sustainable role
**Visible:** Department measurably better, attracting talent
**Team:** Self-sufficient, capable, growing
**Outcome:** Proof it works OR exit with demonstrated leadership

## My Day in 12 Months
- Morning: Deep architecture work (design, standards, strategic thinking)
- Midday: Reviews and guidance (not execution)
- Afternoon: Mentoring and development
- NOT: Firefighting, doing everyone's work, drowning

## The Specific Architecture Work I'm Protecting Time For
1. Design next phase of cloud migration with proper scalability
2. Create comprehensive data governance framework
3. Build design pattern library and decision frameworks
4. Mentor and develop the team I need
5. Make the systems clear through excellent documentation

## When I Hesitate to Delegate
**Remember:** Every task I do that someone else should do is time stolen from this vision.

**Remember:** I can't build this without freeing up bandwidth.

**Remember:** Delegation isn't avoiding work - it's enabling the right work.

## The Ultimate Test (Month 12)
**Question:** Is this organization functional enough to keep building in?

**If YES:** Stay. Continue building. This is working.

**If NO:** Leave. But I'll leave with:
- Demonstrated ability to build teams and competency
- Framework that works
- Portfolio of leadership
- Story that sells: "I built excellence in dysfunction - hire me to build it in function"

Either way, I win.
