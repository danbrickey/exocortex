**Last Updated**: October 15, 2025
**Quarter**: Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec)
**Review Frequency**: Weekly (in weekly reviews), Monthly (in monthly reviews)

---

## Vision Reference
See [vision.md](vision.md) for overarching 12-month vision: "Build an island of competency in a sea of organizational dysfunction."

See [architecture_goals.md](architecture_goals.md) for 3/6/12-month milestone framework.

## This Quarter's Focus (Oct-Dec 2025)

### Theme
**Foundation Building**: Delegation, team development, and freeing up bandwidth for strategic work

---

## 3-Month Goals (By End of December 2025)

### Goal 1: Establish Consistent Delegation Practice
**Target**: Delegate 3-5 tasks/week consistently, free up 30% of time for architecture work

**Why**: Current state is unsustainable (80% tactical, 20% strategic). Need to shift to 50-60% strategic work.

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] 3-5 tasks delegated per week (tracked in delegation_log.md)
- [ ] 30% time freed up (measured via time tracking in daily journals)
- [ ] 90%+ delegation success rate (no major failures)
- [ ] Delegation anxiety measurably decreased

**Key Actions**:
- Use delegation scripts and frameworks
- Track fears vs. outcomes to build evidence
- Start small, build momentum
- Archive successes for confidence-building

**Current Status** (as of [date]):
- Progress: X%
- Tasks delegated this month: X
- Time freed up: X%
- Blockers: [Any blockers]

---

### Goal 2: Develop 2-3 Mentees
**Target**: Identify and begin actively mentoring 2-3 team members who can handle tasks I currently do

**Why**: Building team capability is the only sustainable path to freeing up my time and creating the "island of competency."

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] 2-3 mentees identified with clear development plans
- [ ] Regular 1:1 mentoring sessions (biweekly minimum)
- [ ] Mentees successfully handling tasks I used to do
- [ ] Measurable progress on their development goals

**Key Actions**:
- Identify candidates: [Names being considered]
- Create individual development plans
- Assign stretch projects
- Provide feedback and coaching

**Current Status** (as of [date]):
- Mentees active: X
- Sessions this month: X
- Tasks successfully delegated to mentees: X
- Blockers: [Any blockers]

---

### Goal 3: Create Technical Standards & Documentation Framework
**Target**: Draft and socialize initial technical standards that make self-service possible

**Why**: People can't self-serve without clear standards and good documentation. This is prerequisite for sustainable delegation.

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Code review standards documented
- [ ] Documentation requirements defined
- [ ] Design pattern library started (3-5 patterns)
- [ ] C4 architecture diagram framework created
- [ ] Standards socialized with teams (workshop or async)

**Key Actions**:
- Draft code review checklist
- Create documentation template
- Document 3-5 common design patterns
- Set up C4 diagram structure in LucidChart
- Present to teams for feedback

**Current Status** (as of [date]):
- Standards created: X/5
- Socialized with: [Teams/individuals]
- Adoption: [Early feedback]
- Blockers: [Any blockers]

---

## Supporting Goals

### Goal 4: Reduce Firefighting and Reactive Work
**Target**: Reduce unplanned work from 30% of time to 15% of time

**How**:
- Better documentation reduces questions
- Delegation reduces tactical work
- Standards reduce rework

**Metric**: Track "firefighting" hours in daily journal

---

### Goal 5: Increase Strategic Architecture Work
**Target**: Shift from 20% strategic work to 50% strategic work

**Strategic Work Includes**:
- System design
- Setting standards
- Reviewing implementations (not doing implementations)
- Quality assurance at integration points
- Developing the team

**Metric**: Track time distribution in weekly reviews

---

## Weekly Milestones

### October 2025
- Week 1 (Oct 7-11):
  - [ ] Begin delegation practice (2-3 tasks)
  - [ ] Identify mentee candidates
  - [ ] Start drafting code review standards
- Week 2 (Oct 14-18):
  - [ ] Delegate 3-5 tasks
  - [ ] Schedule first mentoring sessions
  - [ ] Continue standards documentation
- Week 3 (Oct 21-25):
  - [ ] Maintain 3-5 delegations/week
  - [ ] Complete code review standards draft
  - [ ] First design pattern documented
- Week 4 (Oct 28-Nov 1):
  - [ ] Maintain delegation momentum
  - [ ] Socialize standards with one team (pilot)
  - [ ] Monthly review and course corrections

### November 2025
[To be planned]

### December 2025
[To be planned]

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- Team members have bandwidth to take on delegated work
- Management supports shift from tactical to strategic focus
- Time to document standards while still doing day-to-day work

### Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Delegation "failures" derail confidence | Medium | High | Track evidence, use scripts, expect learning curve |
| Team members too busy | Medium | Medium | Start small, coordinate with team leads |
| Standards take too long to create | Medium | Medium | Minimum viable standards, iterate |
| No bandwidth to mentor | Low | High | Mentoring IS the work (creates future bandwidth) |

## Alignment with Career Goals

These BCI goals directly support career plan goals:
- **Phase 0 (Career Plan)**: Delegation and workflow optimization → Same as Goal 1
- **Blue Cross AI Transformation**: Building team capability enables AI projects
- **Portfolio**: Team development and standards work are portfolio-worthy achievements

---

## Review Cadence

- **Daily**: Track in daily journal (delegations, time spent, progress)
- **Weekly**: Assess in weekly review (are we hitting 3-5 delegations/week?)
- **Monthly**: Measure metrics, course-correct, update this document
- **Quarterly**: Major assessment, set next quarter's goals

---

## Notes
- These goals are integrated with career plan but focused on BCI-specific transformation
- Success here enables success in career plan (time for learning, POC work, etc.)
- Archive this document to `quarterly_goals/2025_Q4_goals.md` at end of quarter
