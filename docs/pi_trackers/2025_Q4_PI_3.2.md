## Weekly Rhythm Within Each Sprint

To make this actually happen, you need a weekly pattern:
### Week 1 of Sprint:
Wednesday:

Review sprint goals
Identify this week's delegations (mentorship + regular work)
Schedule mentee check-ins

Thursday-Friday-Monday:

Documentation work: 2-3 hours
Mentee guidance: 1-2 meetings/reviews
Regular delegations: 2-3 tasks handed off
Regular work: As needed

Teusday:

Update delegation log
Review mentee progress
Plan next week

### Week 2 of Sprint:
Wednesday:

Check sprint progress
Adjust if behind
More delegations

Thursday-Friday-Monday:

Documentation work: 2-3 hours
Mentee reviews/feedback sessions
Regular delegations: 2-3 tasks
Regular work: As needed

Teusday:

Sprint retrospective
Update delegation log for full sprint
Celebrate completions
Plan next sprint

Key: Documentation work gets 2-3 focused sessions per sprint (4-6 hours total). Mentorship is ongoing through the sprint.

## Mentoring
Making Mentorship Actually Happen
Your mentees ARE your delegation practice. Here's how to make it work:
Jason (Code Guidelines/Reviews)
Sprint 2-3: Learning

He documents current state, drafts standards
You guide and refine
Your time: 2-3 hours per sprint (meetings + review)

Sprint 4-5: Practicing

He uses standards in real reviews
You review his reviews
Your time: 1-2 hours per sprint (spot-checking)

Sprint 6+: Leading

He owns code reviews for an area
You audit periodically
Your time: 1 hour per sprint (oversight)

What you're delegating TO him:

Code reviews you used to do
Creating code standards you'd have to create
Eventually: AI code evaluation work

Shreya (Work Specs/Refactoring)
Sprint 2-3: Learning

She documents her process, tries with guidance
You provide scaffolding
Your time: 2-3 hours per sprint

Sprint 4-5: Practicing

She takes on refactoring tasks with less guidance
You review outputs
Your time: 1-2 hours per sprint

Sprint 6+: Independent

She chooses and executes refactoring work
Documents process for others
Your time: 1 hour per sprint (review)

What you're delegating TO her:

Refactoring work you'd do
Work specification creation
Eventually: Training others on the process

Nicole (Data Governance/Business Rules)
Sprint 2-3: Learning

She takes on terminology/business rule work
You provide frameworks
Your time: 2-3 hours per sprint

Sprint 4-5: Expanding

She coordinates with business domain experts
Facilitates council meetings
Your time: 1-2 hours per sprint (coaching)

Sprint 6+: Leading

She owns data governance for areas
You provide strategic direction only
Your time: 1 hour per sprint

What you're delegating TO her:

Data governance work that was falling on data engineers
Business coordination you were doing
Council facilitation


The Time Math
Your current state: 60% doing others' work, 20% architecture, 20% meetings/coordination
By Sprint 6 (end of quarter):
Documentation: 4-6 hours per sprint = ~15% of your time
Mentorship: 3-6 hours per sprint = ~15% of your time
Delegation practice: Ongoing, part of normal work
Strategic architecture: 40-50% of your time (up from 20%)
Coordination/meetings: 20% (unchanged)
This is exactly the shift you want: Moving from execution to strategy + development.

## Full PI plan
Sprint-by-Sprint Breakdown
Sprint 2 (Starting Tomorrow) - Foundation Sprint
Theme: Set up frameworks + first mentorship delegations
Documentation Work (Your Time: ~30% of sprint):

✅ Shreya: First delegation

Task: "Document the simple refactoring process you built. What steps did you follow? What worked/didn't work?"
Your role: Ask her to write it up, you'll review together
Outcome: She reflects on her process, you see her understanding level


✅ Nicole: Initial connection

Task: "Let's meet for 30 minutes. I want to understand what terminology/business rule work you're taking on and how I can support you."
Your role: Understand her current state, identify first delegation opportunity
Outcome: Relationship established, you understand her starting point



Delegation Practice (Ongoing):

Continue 3-5 delegations per week on regular work
Log everything
These mentorship tasks count toward your weekly delegation target
