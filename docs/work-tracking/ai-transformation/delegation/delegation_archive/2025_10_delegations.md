## **DATE DELEGATED**: 2025_10_07
- **TASK**: Bug in member consecutive coverage model to Carl's team
- **DELEGATE**: Carl Morse to assign an engineer
- **REFLECTION**:
  - **Fear**: Carl would be annoyed/burdened
  - **Outcome**: Carl agreed it was his team's responsibility, seemed fine. My prediction was wrong. Nothing bad happened.
  - **Insights** I delegated a bug in the member consecutive coverage model to Carl Morse's team. Probably Brad will be working on it. I did give Carl a little bit of wiggle room in the conversation by offering to kick it over to the offshore data engineering team if his team didn't have bandwidth. I could have been more direct and still been tactful, but I did it, and it wasn't too bad. Carl seemed cool with it and offered that he thought it was his teams responsibility. That was weird to me because he is the one that 'asked' me to help with it. I think I interpreted his ask as wanting me to do it, which made sense in my head because I have the ability to fix it. However, I think he actually just wanted my direction on what could be causing the bug. So he probably would have been ok with me just answering the question and telling him to assign it to a data engineer on his team. I am glad I did it. Still a little anxious about it and a little bit mentally exhausted. I wrote a script, although I barely used it, but it did make me feel a little more comfortable with the task. I also enabled my own dysfunction by sort of asking for permission from the program manager, Linsey. And then my request was a little too tentative because I offered to not give it to Carl's team if they were too busy and assign it to an offshore engineer.

## **DATE DELEGATED**: 2025_10_07
- **TASK**:  Gitlab branch protection for /Snowflake/edp_data_domains
- **DELEGATE**: Shawn Trent
- **FOLLOW-UP**: 2025_10_14
- **REFLECTION**:
  - **Fear**: Shawn will be annoyed I'm not learning gitlab myself
  - **Outcome**: "I'll take a look, give me a bit".
    - Response time: hour
    - Tone: Casual, professional, no signs of annoyance
  - **Insights** 
    - Knew rationally it was fine but still felt anxious
    - Discomfort is part of retraining process
    - Second delegation in two days - building momentum
    - Noticing pattern: My brain wants to discount positive evidence
    - Need to trust observable evidence, not imagined scenarios
    - The "secretly annoyed" thought is my brain's way of dismissing evidence
    - This is called 'Discounting the positive' which is wrong - you should trust the evidence until you have reason not to. This frame of mind will put me in failure mode long term
    - Two delegations, two fine outcomes (Carl and Shawn)
    - Walking the dogs helped regulate after
